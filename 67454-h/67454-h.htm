<small>THE BONANZA KING</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The cold of foot-hill California in the month of
January held the night. The occupants of the
surrey were too cramped and stiffened by it, and
too uncomfortably enwrapped against it, to speak.
Silence as complete as that which lay like a spell
on the landscape brooded over them. At the
last stopping place, Chinese Gulch, a scattering
of houses six miles behind them on the mountain
road, they had halted at the main saloon, and
whisky and water had been passed to the driver
and to the burlier figure on the back seat. The
watchers that thronged to the saloon door had
eyed the third occupant of the carriage with the
intent, sheepish curiosity of the isolated man in
presence of the stranger female. Afterward,
each one was voluble in his impressions of her
face, pale in the smoky lamplight, and the hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
that slid, small and white, out of its loose glove
when the warming glass was offered her.</p>

<p>Since then both she and her companion had
leaned back in their several corners and preserved
an unbroken silence. Even the driver&#8217;s tongue
had showed the benumbing effects of the darkness
and cold, and the flow of conversation with which,
earlier in the day, he had entertained his fares,
gradually languished and died.</p>

<p>The surrey sped swiftly along the road which
wound in spectral pallor over the shoulder of the
foot-hill, now dipping into the blackness of a
ravine, then creeping up a bare slope, where the
horses&#8217; hoofs dug in laboriously amid loosened
stones. The solemn loneliness of the landscape,
faintly revealed by the light of large, clear stars,
seemed to find appropriate expression in this
frosty, smoke-breathing stillness. There was not
a sign of human life. The gray patches of fields
melted into the clouded darkness of trees. The
domes of the live-oaks were like cairns of funereal
rock in the open spaces. Steep, woody slopes
swept upward, in the daytime shivering coppices
of wintry leafage pierced by spires of fir and pine,
now densely black and mysterious under the transforming
magic of the night. Over all an expanse
of sky arched, the vast, calm sky of mountain
regions and Nature&#8217;s undesecrated places, crystal-clear
and velvet-dark, the light of its stars seeming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
to come, tapping messages in an unknown telegraphy,
from illimitable distances.</p>

<p>The larger figure on the back seat moved, and
turned a face, all of which was hidden save the
eyes, toward its companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hungry?&#8221; queried a deep bass voice; the
inquiring polysyllable shot out suddenly over an
upturned bulwark of collars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fearfully,&#8221; came the answer in a muffled
feminine treble, that suited the more diminutive
bulk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get a move on, Jake,&#8221; to the driver. &#8220;This
girl&#8217;s most famished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your horses,&#8221; growled the other man;
&#8220;we&#8217;re just about there.&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words the woman pricked up her
ears, and, leaning forward, peered ahead. As they
rounded a protruding angle of hill, a huddle of
roofs and walls spotted with lights came into
view, and the sight drew her hand forward with
an eagerly-pointing finger.</p>

<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s Rocky Bar!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Have
we really got there at last?&#8221;</p>

<p>The driver chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Rocky Bar all right. Now get your
appetite good and ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No need,&#8221; she responded gaily; &#8220;it&#8217;s been
ready and waiting for hours. I was beginning
to think that you&#8217;d lost your way.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>&#8220;Me!&#8221; with an accent of incredulous scorn.
&#8220;Ah, get out! How does it come, Governor,
that Bill Cannon&#8217;s girl don&#8217;t know no more about
these parts than a young lady from New York?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s never been up here before,&#8221; said the
man on the back seat, beginning to untangle
himself from his enfolding rugs. &#8220;I&#8217;ve brought
her up with me this time to show her some of
the places where her pa used to work round with
the boys, long before <i>she</i> was ever thought of.&#8221;</p>

<p>A loud barking of dogs broke out as they
approached the first detached houses of the settlement.
Shapes appeared at the lighted doorways,
and as the surrey drew up at the hotel balcony
a crowding of heads was seen in the windows.
The entire population of Rocky Bar spent its
evenings at this hospitable resort, in summer on
the balcony under the shade of the locust trees,
in winter round the office stove, spitting and smoking
in cheery sociability. But at this hour the
great event of Rocky Bar&#8217;s day was over. The
eight stages, the passengers of which dined
at the hotel, had long passed onward on their
various routes up and down the &#8220;mother lode&#8221;
and into the camps of the Sierra. That the
nightly excitement of the &#8220;victualing up&#8221;
was to be supplemented by a late arrival in a
surrey, driven by Jake McVeigh, the proprietor
of the San Jacinto stables, and accompanied by
a woman, was a sensational event not often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
awarded to Rocky Bar, even in the heyday of
summer-time.</p>

<p>The occupants of the office crowded into the
doorway and pressed themselves against the windows.
They saw that the man who alighted
was a thick-set, portly figure, with a short, gray
beard and a suggestion of gray hair below the
brim of a black wide-awake. Of the lady, shown
but dimly by the light of the open door, only a
slim, cloaked outline and a glint of fair hair
were discernible. But, anyway, it was a woman,
and of a kind unusual in Rocky Bar, and the
men stared, sunk in bashful appreciation of a
beauty that they felt must exist, if it were only
to be in keeping with the hour, the circumstances,
and their own hopeful admiration.</p>

<p>The hotel proprietor, an ancient man with a
loosened vest, and trousers tucked into long boots,
dispersed them as he ushered the strangers into
the office. That they were travelers of distinction
was obvious, as much from their own
appearance as from the fact that Jake McVeigh
was driving them himself, in his best surrey and
with his finest team. But just how important
they were no one guessed till McVeigh followed
them in, and into ears stretched for the information
dropped the sentence, half-heard, like a stage
aside:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Bill Cannon and his daughter Rose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon the proprietor it had an electric effect.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
He sped from the room with the alertness of
youth, promising &#8220;a cold lunch&#8221; in a minute.
To the others it came as a piece of intelligence
that added awe to the lighter emotions of the
occasion. By common consent their eyes focused
on the great man who stood warming his hands
at the stove. Even the rare, unusual woman,
revealed now as sufficiently pretty to be an object
of future dreams, was interesting only to the
younger and more impressionable members of
the throng. All but these gazed absorbed,
unblinking, at Bill Cannon, the Bonanza King.</p>

<p>He was used to it. It had been a part of his
life for years. Eying his admirers with a genial
good humor, he entered into conversation with
them, his manner marked by an easy familiarity,
which swept away all shades of embarrassment,
and drew the men around the stove, eager to
respond to his questions as to the condition and
prospects of the locality. The talk was becoming
general and animated, when the ancient man
returned and announced that the &#8220;cold lunch&#8221;
was ready and to please &#8220;step after him into the
dining-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>This gaunt apartment, grimly unadorned and
faintly illumined, an occasional lantern backed
by a tin reflector projecting a feeble light into its
echoing emptiness, was swept of all intruders,
and showed a barn-like bareness of wall and
loftiness of roof. Lines of tables, uncovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
between flanking wooden benches, were arranged
down its length. Across the end of one of these
a white cloth was spread and three places set.
Jake McVeigh, less innocently democratic than
the hotel proprietor, was about to withdraw
from the society of his distinguished patron and
seat himself in seemly loneliness at an adjacent
table, when Bill Cannon&#8217;s voice arrested him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going off there for, sonny, as
if you were a leper? Come over here and sit
side of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The driver, greatly pleased, not only to enjoy
the companionship of the richest man in California
but to let the peeping heads in the doorway see
him in this moment of proud apotheosis, took the
third seat with modest complacence. Like most
of his kind, the sense of social inferiority was
unknown to him. He was simply and naturally
himself as he would be anywhere in any company.
Even the proximity of Miss Cannon did not abash
him, and he dexterously propelled the potatoes
into his mouth with his knife and cut fiercely at
his meat with a sawing motion, talking the while
with all the freedom and more than the pleasure
with which he talked to his wife in the kitchen
at San Jacinto.</p>

<p>Cannon, his overcoat removed, was seen to be
a powerful, thick-set man, with a bulkiness that
was more a matter of broad build and muscular
development than fat. His coat set ill upon him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
and strained at the buttons. It had the effect
of having worked up toward the shoulders, noticeable
in the clothes of men who are deep-chested
and sit bunchily. He had a short neck which
he accommodated with a turn-down collar, a
gray beard, clipped close to his cheeks and square
on the chin, and gray hair, worn rather long and
combed sleekly and without parting back from
his forehead. In age he was close to seventy,
but the alertness and intelligence of a conquering
energy and vitality were in his glance, and showed
in his movements, deliberate, but sure and full
of precision. He spoke little as he ate his dinner,
leaning over his plate and responding to the
remarks of his daughter with an occasional monosyllable
that might have sounded curt, had it
not been accompanied with a lazy cast of his
eye upon her that was as full of affection as a
caress.</p>

<p>The young lady, who had also put off her outer
wraps, still wore her hat, which was wide-brimmed
and cast a shadow over the upper part of her face.
Below it her hair showed a fine, bright blonde,
giving forth silky gleams in the lamplight. To
the peeping heads in the doorway she seemed a
creature instinct with romantic charm, which was
expressed in such delicacies of appearance as a
pearl-white throat, a rounded chin, and lips that
smiled readily. These graces, eagerly deciphered
through dimness and distance, had the attraction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
of the semi-seen, and imagination, thus given an
encouraging fillip, invested Bill Cannon&#8217;s girl with
a haunting beauty. It was remarked that she
bore no resemblance to her father in coloring,
features, or build. In talking it over later, Rocky
Bar decided that she must favor her mother,
who, as all California knew, had been a waitress
in the Yuba Hotel at Marysville, when Bill
Cannon, then a miner in the Freeze-Out, had
wooed and won her.</p>

<p>The conversation between the diners was desultory.
They were beyond doubt hungry. Even
the young lady was seen to consume the viands
set before her with more gusto than a restraining
sense of romantic fitness would have dictated.
Once or twice, as she bit a semicircle out of a
round of buttered bread, her eye, questing sidewise
full of sly humor, caught McVeigh&#8217;s, and
a sputter of laughter left her with humped-up
shoulders, her lips lightly compressed on the
mouthful.</p>

<p>It was toward the end of the meal, that, looking
at the opposite wall, her glance was caught by
a large clock to which she drew her father&#8217;s
attention:</p>

<p>&#8220;Half-past nine! How fashionable we are!
And when are you going to get us up to Antelope,
Mr. McVeigh?&#8221;</p>

<p>McVeigh studied the clock ponderingly as he
felt in his breast pocket for his toothpick.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if we leave here at ten and
make good time the hull way&mdash;it&#8217;s up hill pretty
much without a break&mdash;I&#8217;ll get you there about
midnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made a little grimace.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it will be much colder, won&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Colder &#8217;n&#8217; colder. You&#8217;ll be goin&#8217; higher with
every step. Antelope&#8217;s on the slope of the Sierra,
and you can&#8217;t expect to be warm up there in the
end of January.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you hadn&#8217;t wanted to come,&#8221; said her
father, &#8220;you&#8217;d have been just about getting ready
for Mrs. Ryan&#8217;s ball. Isn&#8217;t this about the magic
hour when you begin to lay on the first layer of
war-paint?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl looked at the clock, nodding with a
faint, reminiscent smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just about,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;d have been probably
looking at my dress laid out on the bed and
saying to myself, &#8216;Now I wonder if it&#8217;s worth
while getting into that thing and having all the
bother of going to this ball.&#8217; On the evenings
when I go out, there&#8217;s always a stage when that
happens.&#8221;</p>

<p>McVeigh, with his toothpick in full operation,
looked at her, admiring and half comprehending,
for the first time feeling himself an outsider.
She caught his eye, read its meaning, and with
the quick tact of a delicate nature, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Mrs. Cornelius Ryan in San Francisco.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
She has a ball to-night and I was going, but I
came up here with papa instead. I don&#8217;t care
for balls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sort of late to be primping up for a ball,&#8221;
said McVeigh, restoring the toothpick to his pocket
and pushing back his chair. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go and have
a look at the horses. And, Governor, if you&#8217;ll
be ready in fifteen minutes I&#8217;ll be round at the
porch waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cannon nodded, and, as the driver clumped
off over the board floor, said to his daughter,</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if Dominick Ryan&#8217;ll be there&mdash;at
the ball, I mean. His mother&#8217;s made up her
mind not to recognize the woman he&#8217;s married,
and to freeze her out, but I wonder if she&#8217;ll have
the nerve not to ask her to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how she could do that,&#8221; said the
girl. &#8220;This is one of the largest balls ever given
in San Francisco. She can&#8217;t leave her son out,
and she couldn&#8217;t ask him without his wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t she?&#8221; said the old man, with a
narrowing of his eyes and a knowing wag of his
head. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know Delia Ryan. I do.
I&#8217;ve known her forty years, ever since she was
first married and did washing on the back porch
of her shanty in Virginia City. She was a good
deal of a woman then, a strong, brainy woman,
and she&#8217;s the same to-day, but hard as nails.
I&#8217;ll bet a hat she hasn&#8217;t asked Dominick&#8217;s wife
to that ball.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>&#8220;What do you suppose he&#8217;ll do?&#8221; asked the
daughter, somewhat aghast at this glimpse of
the Ryan family skeleton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me such conundrums. I&#8217;m glad
I&#8217;m not in it, that&#8217;s all I know. When two
women lock horns I&#8217;m ready to step quietly
down and out. I never to my knowledge saw
Dominick&#8217;s wife, but I&#8217;ve heard about her, and
take it she&#8217;s a pretty hard kind of a proposition.
They say she married the boy for money and
position, and hasn&#8217;t got either. Delia, who has
the money, hasn&#8217;t given them a cent since the
marriage; made up her mind, people say, to force
Mrs. Dominick out. She doesn&#8217;t seem to have
done it, and I guess it&#8217;s been sort of aggravating
to her. Just the same I&#8217;d like to know if she&#8217;s
had the nerve not to send the woman an invitation
to the ball. That would be pretty tough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen either Dominick or his wife,&#8221;
said the girl. &#8220;It seems odd when I know Mrs.
Ryan and Cornelia so well. But he married the
year I came back from Europe, and he&#8217;s never
been anywhere since. I don&#8217;t believe he ever
goes to his mother&#8217;s. There&#8217;s Mr. McVeigh in
the doorway; we&#8217;d better be going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once again in the carriage they were soon clear
of the last straggling shanty, and speeding along
the pale, ascending road. The silence that held
the trio before their arrival at Rocky Bar again
fell on them. Wrapped in overcoats and rugs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Bill Cannon appeared to slumber, every now and
then&mdash;as the wheels jolted over a piece of rough
road-bed&mdash;shaken into growling wakefulness.
McVeigh also rolled sleepily in his seat, occasionally
leaning sidewise to spit over the wheel. Only
the girl seemed alert and wide-awake, her face
craning out from the shadowed back seat, her
eyes strained to pierce the obscurity and see for
the first time the landscape of foot-hill California,
of which her father had so often told her.</p>

<p>Now it was all a dark, formless background of
broken blacknesses, where the light, open spaces
of fields alternated with blotches of woods and
trees. At intervals they passed a lone cabin,
solitary in its pale clearing, the red eye of a stove
sending a gleam through an uncurtained pane.
Once they woke the echoes in the single street of
a tiny town, sleeping behind its shuttered windows.
Dogs barked, the shout of a belated
reveler rose from a congeries of gaudily-bright
doorways, and over all, imposing its mighty voice
on the silence, came the roar of the stamp-mill
on the hill above. It rose into the night like a
fortress, a black mass looming from the slant of
vast dumps, lines of lit windows puncturing its
sides. The thunder of its stamps was loud
on the night, fierce and insistent, like the roar
of a monster round whose feet the little town
cowered.</p>

<p>McVeigh looked back over his shoulder, saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
the bright eyes under the hat-brim, and said
softly,</p>

<p>&#8220;The Silver Crescent stamp-mill. The last big
mine we&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the last town they passed; even the
groups of buildings that marked embryo mines
grew rare. The dimly-seen country became
wilder, seemed to shake off the signs of man&#8217;s
encroachment and to be sweeping up into
mountain majesty. The ascending road crept
along the edges of ravines whence the sound of
running water came in a clear clinking, dived
down into black caverns of trees unlighted by
the feeblest ray of star-shine, and then climbed
in slow, laborious loops the bare bulwarks of the
mountain. Had the girl been able to see plainly
she would have noticed the change in the foliage,
the disappearance of the smaller shrubs and
delicate interlacement of naked boughs, and the
mightier growth of the pines, soaring shafts
devoid of branches to a great height. Boulders
appeared among their roots, straight falls of rock
edged the road like the walls of a fort.</p>

<p>McVeigh turned again, and again caught the
bright eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems like your paw must think a lot of
what he&#8217;s heard about the new strike at Greenhide
to come all this way,&#8221; he whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he does,&#8221; came the response in the
same key.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>&#8220;It sort of stumps me to know why you came
along with him,&#8221; he continued, his eyes on the
horses, but leaning back to catch her answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mightn&#8217;t I just want to see the country?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, mebbe you might, but it don&#8217;t seem
to me that you&#8217;re seein&#8217; much of it to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He heard her smothered laugh, shot his
glance back to see her face, and laughed himself,
turning to his horses, and then turning back to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a lively girl, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel very lively just at this minute.
I&#8217;m a cold girl, the coldest in California, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>That made him laugh, too, but he turned back
to his horses, saying with quick consideration:</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you are. Come boys,&#8221; to the horses,
&#8220;we&#8217;ve got to get a move on. We can&#8217;t let this
young lady catch cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>The horses quickened their pace and there was
no more talk. An hour later the first broken
lights of Antelope sparkled along the road. The
old mining camp, in a hollow between two buttresses
of the Sierra, lay shuttered and dreaming
under the starlight. A lamp-lit window, here and
there, showed the course of its straggling main
street, and where the hotel stood, welcoming rays
winked between the boughs of leafless trees.</p>

<p>As the thud of the approaching hoof-beats woke
the echoes a sudden violent barking of dogs broke
out. Antelope was evidently not as sound asleep
as it looked. At the hotel, especially, there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
life and movement. The bar disgorged a throng
of men, and Perley, the proprietor, had to push
his way through them to welcome his midnight
guests. Antelope, though remote, was in telegraphic
communication with the world, and the
operator at Rocky Bar had wired Perley to be
ready for the distinguished arrivals,&mdash;news that
in a half-hour was known throughout the town
and had brought most of the unattached male
population into the hotel.</p>

<p>Jake McVeigh was pulling the luggage from
under the seats and Cannon was interchanging
the first greetings with his landlord, when the
girl, who had gone to the balcony railing and was
looking out into the darkness, cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, papa, snow!&#8221;</p>

<p>The information seemed to startle every one.
The men crowded from the doorway and balcony
into the street. McVeigh set down the bags,
and, turning his weather-beaten face to the sky,
uttered a smothered ejaculation of a profane
character. Cannon came forward to where his
daughter stood and looked into the blackness
beyond. The girl had drawn off her glove and
held her bare hand out, then stepping back to the
light of the window, she showed it to her father.
The white skin was sprinkled with snow crystals.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure enough,&#8221; he said in a thoughtful voice.
&#8220;Well, it won&#8217;t be the first time I&#8217;ve been snowed
up at Antelope.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>A YOUNG MAN MARRIED</small></h2>
</div>

<p>That same evening, at the hour when Bill
Cannon and his daughter were setting out from
Rocky Bar, Dominick Ryan was walking up Van
Ness Avenue toward his mother&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>Dominick did not know at what hours balls
of the kind Mrs. Ryan was giving that evening
were supposed to begin. It was nearly three
years since he had been a participant in such
festal gatherings. He had not been at a dance,
or a dinner, or a theater party since his marriage.
He had heard that these &#8220;functions,&#8221; as people
now called them, began later than they did in
his day. Stopping by a lamp he drew out his
watch&mdash;ten o&#8217;clock. It was later than he
expected. In truth, as he had seen the house
looming massively from its less imposing neighbors,
his foot had lagged, his approach had grown
slower and slower. It was his mother&#8217;s home,
once his own, and as he drew nearer to it his
reluctance to enter grew stronger, more overpoweringly
oppressive.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>In the clear, lamp-dotted night it looked much
larger and more splendid than by day. When
Cornelius Ryan had built it he had wanted to
have the finest house in San Francisco, and he
certainly had achieved the most spacious and
ornate. Its florid ornamentation was now hidden
by the beautifying dark, and on its vast fa&ccedil;ade
numerous windows broke the blackness with
squares of light. In the lower ones the curtains
were drawn, but slivers and cracks of radiance
slipped out and penetrated the dusk of a garden,
where they encountered the glossy surfaces of
leaves and struck into whispering darknesses of
shrubbery.</p>

<p>The stimulating unquiet of festival was in the
air. Round the mouth of the canvas tunnel
that stretched from the door a dingy crowd was
assembled, staring in at nothing more inspiring
than the blank visage of the closed portal. At
every passing footstep each face turned to the
street, hopefully expectant of the first guest. The
whining of catgut strings, swept by tentative
bows, struck on Dominick&#8217;s ear as he pushed his
way through the throng and passed up the tunnel.
Before he touched the bell the door swung back
and a man-servant he had never seen before
murmured in politely low tones,</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen&#8217;s dressing-room first floor to the
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dominick stood uncertain. He was only a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
rare, occasional visitor at his mother&#8217;s house, and
to-night the hall stripped for revelry looked
strangely unfamiliar. The unexpectedness of a
great, new mirror, surmounted by gold heraldic
devices, confused him. The hall chairs were
different. The music, loud now and beginning to
develop from broken chords and phrases into
the languorous rhythm of a waltz measure, came
from behind a grove of palms that stood back
under the stairs, where the organ was built into
the wall. Both to the right and left, wide, unencumbered
rooms opened, brilliantly lighted, with
flowers banked in masses on the mantels and in
the corners. The scent of these blossoms was
rich on the air and seemed to blend naturally&mdash;like
another expression of the same sensuous
delightfulness&mdash;with the dreamy sweetness of the
music.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen&#8217;s dressing-room first floor to the
right,&#8221; repeated the servant, and Dominick became
aware of the man&#8217;s eyes, fixed on him with a
gleam of uneasy scrutiny shining through cultivated
obsequiousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is my&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he was going to say
&#8220;mother,&#8221; but checked himself, amending it
with, &#8220;Where is Mrs. Ryan?&#8221;</p>

<p>The servant indicated the open doorway to the
right and Dominick passed in. Through the
vista of two rooms, their connecting archways
uncurtained, he saw the shining spaciousness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
the ball-room, the room his mother had added
to the house when Cornelia, his sister, had &#8220;come
out.&#8221; It seemed empty and he walked toward
it, stepping softly on rugs of tiger skin and polar
bear. He noticed the ice-like polish of the oak
floor, the lines of gilt chairs, and a thick, fat
garland of roses&mdash;leaves and blossoms combined&mdash;that
was festooned along the wall and
caught up at each sconce.</p>

<p>As he entered he saw his mother and Cornelia.
They had been standing in one corner, Cornelia
adjusting the shade of an electric light. One
white arm was raised, and her skirt of lace was
reflected clearly in the parquet. The light
shone along her bare shoulders, having a gloss
like old marble. From the nape of her neck
her hair, a bright, coarse red, was drawn up.
She seemed all melting shades of cream color and
ivory, but for this flaming crest of copper color.</p>

<p>Her mother was standing beside her watching
the arranging hand. She was sixty-eight years
of age and very stout, but her great wealth made
it possible for her to employ dressmakers who were
artists and experts, and her Parisian costume made
her look almost shapely. It fell about her in
dignified black folds, sparkling discreetly with
some jetted garnishings. With their shifting
gleam the glint of diamonds mingled. She also
wore pearls round her neck and some diamond
ornaments in her elaborately-dressed gray hair.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>The coarseness of her early beginnings could
not be hidden by the most proficient artificers
in millinery or jewels. Delia Ryan had come
from what are vulgarly called &#8220;the lower orders,&#8221;
having, in her ragged childhood, crossed the
plains at the tail-board of an ox cart, and in her
girlhood been a general servant in a miners&#8217;
boarding-house at Sonora. Now, as she stood
watching her daughter&#8217;s moving hand, her face,
set in a frowning rigidity of observation, was
strong but unbeautiful. Her small eyes, shrewd
and sharp, were set high in her head under
brows almost rubbed away. The nose was short,
with an undeveloped bridge and keen, open
nostrils. Her mouth had grown thinner with
years; the lips shut with a significant firmness.
They had never been full, but what redness
and ripeness they had had in youth were now
entirely gone. They were pale, strong lips, the
under one a little more prominent than the
upper.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; said Cornelia. &#8220;Now they&#8217;re all
even,&#8221; and she wheeled slowly, her glance slipping
along the veiled lights of the sconces. In its
circuit it encountered Dominick&#8217;s figure in the
doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dominick!&#8221; she cried, and stood staring,
na&iuml;vely astonished and dismayed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ryan turned with a start, her face suffused
with color. The one word seemed to have an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
electrifying effect upon her, joyous, perturbing&mdash;unquestionably
exciting.</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy!&#8221; she said, and she rustled across
the room with her hands out.</p>

<p>Dominick walked toward her. He was grave,
pale, and looked thoroughly miserable. He had
his cane in one hand, his hat in the other. As
he approached her he moved the hat to his left
hand and took hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve come!&#8221; she said fondly, &#8220;I knew
you would. That&#8217;s my boy. I knew you&#8217;d come
when your mother asked you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve come,&#8221; he said slowly, and looking
down as if desiring to avoid her eyes. &#8220;Yes,
I&#8217;ve come, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped.</p>

<p>His mother&#8217;s glance fell from his face to his
figure and saw under the loose fronts of his overcoat
that he wore his business suit. Her countenance
instantly, with almost electric suddenness,
stiffened into antagonism. Her eye lost its love,
and hardened into a stony look of defiant indignation.
She pulled her hand from his and jerked
back the front of his coat with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this mean?&#8221; she said sharply. &#8220;Why
aren&#8217;t you dressed? The people will be here in
a minute. You can&#8217;t come this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was going home to dress,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
am not sure yet that I can come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she demanded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>His face grew red. The mission on which he
had come was more difficult, more detestable,
than he had supposed it would be. He looked
down at the shining strip of floor between them
and said, trying to make his voice sound easy
and plausible:</p>

<p>&#8220;I came to ask you for an invitation for
Berny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hah!&#8221; said his mother, expelling her breath
in an angry ejaculation of confirmed suspicion.
&#8220;That&#8217;s it, is it? I thought as much!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mama!&#8221; said the girl who had been standing
by, uneasily listening. &#8220;Mama dear&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice was soft and sweet, a placating
woman&#8217;s voice. And as she drew nearer to them,
her figure seeming to float over the shining parquet
in its pale spread of gauzy draperies, her tone,
her face, and her bearing were instinct with a
pleading, feminine desire to soothe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep quiet, Cornie,&#8221; said her mother, &#8220;you&#8217;re
not in this&#8221;&mdash;turning to Dominick. &#8220;And so
your wife sent you up here to beg for an invitation?
She&#8217;s got you under her thumb to that
extent? Well, go back to her and tell her that
she can send you forty times and you&#8217;ll not get
it. She can make you crawl here and you&#8217;ll not
get it&mdash;not while this is my house. When I&#8217;m
dead you can do what you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned away from him, her face dark with
stirred blood, her body quivering. Anger was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
not the only passion that shook her. Deeper
than this went outraged pride, love turned to
gall, impotent fury that the woman her son had
married had power over him so to reduce his
pride and humble his manhood&mdash;her only son,
the joy and glory of her old age, her Benjamin.</p>

<p>He looked after her, uncertain, frowning, desperate.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not right,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;It&#8217;s not fair.
You&#8217;re unjust to her and to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman moved across the room to the
corner where she had been standing when he
entered. She did not turn, and he continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re asking people to this ball that you
hardly know. Everybody in San Francisco&#8217;s
going. What harm has Berny done that you
should leave her out this way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want women with that kind of record
in my house. I don&#8217;t ask decent people here
to meet that sort,&#8221; said his mother over her
shoulder.</p>

<p>He gave a suppressed exclamation, the meaning
of which it was difficult to read, then said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you never going to forget the past,
mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>She wheeled round toward him almost shouting,</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no&mdash;no! Never! Never! Make your
mind up to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>They looked at each other across the open
space, the angry defiance in their faces not hiding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
the love and appeal that spoke in their eyes.
The mother longed to take her son in her arms;
the son longed to lay his head on her shoulder
and forget the wretchedness and humiliations of
the last two years. But they were held apart,
not only by the specter of the absent woman,
but on the one side by a fierce, unbendable pride,
and on the other by an unforgettable sense of
obligation and duty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother!&#8221; he exclaimed, half-turning away
with a movement of despair.</p>

<p>His mother looked at him from under her
lowered brows, her under lip thrust out, her face
unrelenting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here whenever you like,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;as often as you want. It&#8217;s your home, Dominick,
mine and yours. But it&#8217;s not your wife&#8217;s.
Understand that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned away and again moved slowly
toward the corner, her rich skirts trailing fanwise
over the parquet. He stood, sick at heart,
looking at the tip of his cane as it rested on the
floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dominick,&#8221; said his sister&#8217;s voice beside him,
&#8220;go; that&#8217;s the only thing to do. You see it&#8217;s
no use.&#8221; She made a backward jerk of her head
toward their mother, and then, struck by the
misery of the eyes he lifted to her face, said
tenderly, &#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry. You know I&#8217;d have
sent it if I could. But it&#8217;s no use. It&#8217;s just the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
same old fight over again and nothing gained.
Tell your wife it&#8217;s hopeless. Make her give it
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned slowly, his head hanging.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell her. Good-night,
mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, Dominick,&#8221; came the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, Cornie,&#8221; he said in a muffled
voice and left the room.</p>

<p>He passed through the brilliantly bright, flower-scented
parlors and was shown out by the strange
man-servant. The crowd at the mouth of the
canvas tunnel had increased. Clumps of staring
white faces edged the opening and presented themselves
to his eye, not like reality, but like a painting
of pale visages executed on the background of the
night. They drew away as he approached them,
making a lane of egress for him, then turned and
eyed him&mdash;a deserter from the realms of joy&mdash;as
he stopped by a lamp-post to look at his watch.
A quarter past ten. He had been in the house
only fifteen minutes. He did not need to go
home for a while yet. He could walk about
and think and arrange how he would tell Berny.</p>

<p>He was a man in the full vigor of his youth,
strong and brave, yet at this moment he feared,
feared as a child or a timid woman might fear,
the thought of his wife. He dreaded to meet
her; he shrank from it, and to put it off he wandered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
about the familiar streets, up one and down the
other, trying to overcome his sick reluctance,
trying to make up his mind to go to her, trying
to conquer his fear.</p>

<small>THE DAUGHTER OF HETH</small></h2>
</div>

<p>He walked for nearly an hour, along quiet,
lamp-lit streets where large houses fronted on
gardens that exhaled moist earth scents and the
breaths of sweet, unseen blossoms, up hills so
steep that it seemed as if an earthquake might
have heaved up the city&#8217;s crust and bent it crisply
like a piece of cardboard. From these high
places he looked down on the expanse of the bay,
a stretch of ink surrounded by black hills, here
and there spangled with the clustered sparklings
of little towns. In the hollows below him he
saw the lights of the city swimming on its darkness,
winking and trembling on receding depths
of blackness, like golden bubbles seething on the
surface of thick, dense wine.</p>

<p>He looked down unseeing, thinking of the last
three years.</p>

<p>When he had first met Bernice Iverson, she had
been a typewriter and stenographer in the office
of the Merchants and Mechanics Trust Company.
He was twenty-four at the time, the only son of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Cornelius Ryan, one of the financial magnates
of the far West. The career of Con Ryan, as
he was familiarly called, had been as varied as
the heart of a public, who loves to dwell on the
sensational fortunes of its great men, could have
wished. In the early days of Virginia City, Con
Ryan had been a miner there, had a claim of
his own and lost all he had in it before the first
Crown Point excitement, had run a grocery
store in Shasta, moved to Sacramento, speculated
successfully in mining stock and real estate, and
in the bonanza days had had money to play
the great game which made millionaires of the
few and beggars of the many. He had played it
daringly and with profit. When he died he left
his widow complete control of a fortune of ten
millions.</p>

<p>She had been a sturdy helpmeet&mdash;it was generally
said that she was the best man of the two&mdash;and
would keep the fortune safe for the two
children, Dominick and Cornelia. Neither she
nor Con believed in young men having control
of large fortunes. They had seen what came
of it in the sons of their bonanza friends. Dominick
was sent to the East to college, and on
his return, being then twenty-three years of age,
was placed in the Oregon and California Bank,
of which his father had been one of the founders.
He was soon promoted to a position where
he earned a salary of three thousand a year.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
This was all he had when he met Bernice Iverson.</p>

<p>She was seven years older than he, but told him
they were the same age. It was not a wasted
lie, as she undoubtedly looked much younger than
she was, being a slight, trimly-made woman who
had retained a girlish elasticity of figure and
sprightliness of manner. She came of respectable,
hard-working people, her father, Danny Iverson,
having been a contractor in a small way of business,
and her two sisters being, one a teacher in the
primary school department, the other a saleswoman
in a fashionable millinery. She herself
was an expert in her work, in office hours quiet,
capable and businesslike, afterward lively, easy-going
and companionable. The entrapping of
young Ryan was a simple matter. He had
never loved and knew little of women. He did
not love her, but she made him think he did,
threw herself at him, led him quickly to the point
she wished to reach, and secretly, without a suspicion
on the part of her family, became his mistress.
Six months later, having driven him to the step
by her upbraidings and her apparent sufferings of
conscience under the sense of wrong-doing, she
persuaded him to marry her.</p>

<p>The marriage was a bombshell to the world
in which young Ryan was a planet of magnitude.
His previous connection with her&mdash;though afterward
discovered by his mother&mdash;was at the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
unknown. Bernice had induced him to keep the
marriage secret till its hour of accomplishment,
for she knew Mrs. Ryan would try to break it
off and feared that she might succeed. Once
Dominick&#8217;s wife she thought that the objections
and resentment of the elder woman could be
overcome. But she underrated the force and
obstinacy of her adversary and the depth of the
wound that had been given her. Old Mrs. Ryan
had been stricken in her tenderest spot. Her
son was her idol, born in her middle-age, the last
of four boys, three of whom had died in childhood.
In his babyhood she had hoarded money
and worked late and early that he might be rich.
Now she held the great estate of her husband in
trust for him, and dreamed of the time when he
should marry some sweet and virtuous girl and
she would have grandchildren to love and spoil
and plan for. When the news of his marriage
reached her and she saw the woman he had made
his wife, she understood everything. She knew
her boy through and through and she knew just
how he had been duped and entangled.</p>

<p>She was of that race of pioneer Californians who
had entered an uninhabited country, swept aside
Indian and Spaniard, and made it their own.
They were isolated figures in a huge landscape,
their characters, uncramped and bold, developing
unrestricted in an atmosphere of physical and
moral liberty. They grew as their instincts dictated;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
the bough was not bent into convenient
forms by expediency or pressure from without.
Public opinion had little or no weight with
them, for there was none. It was the pleasure of
this remote group in this rich and exuberant
land to do away with tradition and be a law
and precept unto themselves. What other
people thought and did did not influence them.
They had one fixed, dominating idea in a fluctuating
code of morals&mdash;they knew what they
wanted and they were determined to get it. They
were powerful individualities whether for good
or evil, and they resented with a passion any
thwarting of their plans or desires, whether by
the interposition of man or the hand of God.</p>

<p>Delia Ryan&#8217;s life had been a long, ascending
series of hardly-won triumphs. She had surmounted
what would have seemed to a less bold
spirit unsurmountable obstacles; gone over them,
not around them. She had acquired the habit
of success, of getting what she wanted. Failure
or defiance of her plans amazed her as they might
have amazed the confident, all-conquering, pagan
gods. The center of her life was her family; for
them she had labored, for them she would have
died. Right and wrong in her mind were clearly
defined till it came to her husband or children,
and then they were transmuted into what benefited
the Ryans and what did not. Rigidly
fair and honorable in her dealings with the outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
world, let a member of that world menace
the happiness of one of her own, and she would
sacrifice it, grind the ax without qualms, like
a priestess grimly doing her duty.</p>

<p>The marriage of her son was the bitterest blow
of her life. It came when she was old, stiffened
into habits of dominance and dictatorship, when
her ambitions for her boy were gaining daily in
scope and splendor. A blind rage and determination
to crush the woman were her first feelings,
and remained with her but slightly mitigated by
the softening passage of time. She was a partizan,
a fighter, and she instituted a war against her
daughter-in-law which she conducted with all the
malignant bitterness that marks the quarrels of
women.</p>

<p>Dominick had not been married a month when
she discovered the previous connection between
him and his wife, and published it to the winds.
A social power, feared and obeyed, she let it be
known that to any one who received Mrs. Dominick
Ryan her doors would be for ever closed.
Without withdrawing her friendship from her
son she refused ever to meet or to receive his wife.
In this attitude she was absolutely implacable.
She imposed her will upon the less strong spirits
about her, and young Mrs. Ryan was as completely
shut off from her husband&#8217;s world as though her
skirts carried contamination. With masculine
largeness of view in other matters, in this one the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
elder woman exhibited a singular, unworthy
smallness. The carelessly large checks she had
previously given Dominick on his birthday and
anniversaries ceased to appear, and masculine
gifts, such as pipes, walking-sticks, and cigar-cases,
in which his wife could have no participating
enjoyment, took their place. She had established
a policy of exclusion, and maintained it rigidly.</p>

<p>Young Mrs. Ryan had at first believed that
this rancor would melt away with the flight of
time. But she did not know the elder woman.
She was as unmeltable as a granite rock. The
separation from her son, now with age growing
on her, ate like an acid into the mother&#8217;s heart.
She saw him at intervals, and the change in him,
the growth of discouragement, the dejection of
spirit that he hid from all the world, but that her
eye, clairvoyant from love, detected, tore her
with helpless wrath and grief. She punished herself
and punished him, sacrificed them both, in
permitting herself the indulgence of her implacable
indignation.</p>

<p>Bernice, who had expected to gain all from her
connection with the all-powerful Ryans, at the
end of two years found that she was an ostracized
outsider from the world she had hoped to enter,
and that the riches she had expected to enjoy
were represented by the three thousand a year
her husband earned in the bank. Her attempts
to force her way into the life and surroundings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
where she had hoped her marriage would place
her had invariably failed. If her feelings were
not of the same nature as those of the elder Mrs.
Ryan, they were fully as poignant and bitter.</p>

<p>The effort to get an invitation to the ball had
been the most daring the young woman had yet
made. Neither she nor Dominick had thought
it possible that Mrs. Ryan would leave her out.
So confident was she that she would be asked that
she had ordered a dress for the occasion. But
when Dominick&#8217;s invitation came without her
name on the envelope, then fear that she was to
be excluded rose clamorous in her. For days
she talked and complained to her husband as
to the injustice of this course and his power to
secure the invitation for her if he would. By
the evening of the ball she had brought him to
the point where he had agreed to go forth and
demand it.</p>

<p>It was a hateful mission. He had never in
his life done anything so humiliating. In his
shame and distress he had hoped that his mother
would give it to him without urging, and Bernice,
placated, would be restored to good humor and
leave him at peace. She could not have gained
such power over him, or so bent him to her bidding,
had she not had in him a fulcrum of guilty obligation
to work on. She continually reminded
him of &#8220;the wrong&#8221; he had done her, and how,
through him, she had lost the respect of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
fellows and her place among them. All these
slights, snubs and insults were his fault, and he
felt that this was true. To-night he had gone
forth in dogged desperation. Now in fear, frank
fear of her, he went home, slowly, with reluctant
feet, his heart getting heavier, his dread colder
as he neared the house.</p>

<p>It was one of those wooden structures on Sacramento
Street not far from Van Ness Avenue
where the well-to-do and socially-aspiring crowd
themselves into a floor of seven rooms, and derive
satisfaction from the proximity of their distinguished
neighbors who refuse to know them.
It contained four flats, each with a parlor bay-window
and a front door, all four doors in neighborly
juxtaposition at the top of a flight of six
marble steps.</p>

<p>Dominick&#8217;s was the top flat; he had to ascend
a long, carpeted stairway with a turn half-way up
to get to it. Now, looking at the bay-window, he
saw lights gleaming from below the drawn blinds.
Berny was still up. A lingering hope that she
might have gone to bed died, and his sense of
reluctance gained in force and made him feel
slightly sick. He was there, however, and he
had to go up. Fitting his key into the lock he
opened the hall door.</p>

<p>It was very quiet as he mounted the long
stairs, but, as he drew near the top, he became
aware of a windy, whistling noise and looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
into the room near the stair-head saw that all
the gas-jets were lit and turned on full cock, and
that the gas, rushing out from the burner in a
ragged banner of flame, made the sound. He
was about to enter and lower it when he heard
his wife&#8217;s voice coming from the open door of
her room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that you, Dominick?&#8221; she called.</p>

<p>Her voice was steady and high. Though it
was hard, with a sort of precise clearness of
utterance, it was not conspicuously wrathful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;it&#8217;s I,&#8221; and he forgot
the gas-jets and walked up the hall. He did
not notice that in the other rooms he passed the
gas was turned on in the same manner. The
whistling rush of its escape made a noise like an
excited, unresting wind in the confined limits of
the little flat.</p>

<p>The door of Berny&#8217;s room was open, and under
a blaze of light from the chandelier and the side
lights by the bureau she was sitting in a rocking-chair
facing the foot of the bed. She held in
her hand a walking-stick of Dominick&#8217;s and with
this she had been making long scratches across
the foot-board, which was of walnut and was
seamed back and forth, like a rock scraped by
the passage of a glacier. As Dominick entered,
she desisted, ceased rocking, and turned to look
at him. She had an air of taut, sprightly impudence,
and was smiling a little.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>&#8220;Well, Dominick,&#8221; she said jauntily, &#8220;you&#8217;re
late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I believe I am,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I did
not come straight back. I walked about for a
while.&#8221;</p>

<p>He slowly crossed the room to the fireplace
and stood there looking down. There were some
silk draperies on the mantel matched by those
which were festooned over the room&#8217;s single
window. He fastened his eyes on the pattern
stamped on the looped-up folds, and was silent.
He thought Berny would realize from the fact
that he had not come directly home that the
invitation had been denied. This was his bungling,
masculine way of breaking the news.</p>

<p>&#8220;Took a walk,&#8221; she said, turning to the bed
and beginning to rock. &#8220;It&#8217;s a queer sort of
hour to choose for walking,&#8221; and lifting the cane
she recommenced her occupation of scratching
the foot-board with it, tracing long, parabolic
curves across the entire expanse, watching the
cane&#8217;s tip with her head tilted to one side. Dominick,
who was not looking at her, did not notice
the noise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; she said, tracing a great arc
from one side to the other, &#8220;that you were with
your loving family&mdash;opening the ball, probably.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not move, but said quietly,</p>

<p>&#8220;It was impossible to get the invitation,
Berny. I tried to do it and was refused. I want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
you to understand that as long as I live I&#8217;ll never
do a thing like that again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you will,&#8221; she said, laughing and
shaking her head like an amused child. &#8220;Oh,
yes, you will.&#8221; She threw her head back and,
looking at the ceiling, laughed still louder with a
note of fierceness in the sound. &#8220;You&#8217;ll do it
and lots more things like it. You&#8217;ll do it if I
want you to, Dominick Ryan.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not answer. She hitched her chair
closer to the bed as if to return to an engrossing
pastime, and, leaning back luxuriously,
resumed her play with the cane. This time
Dominick noticed the noise and turned. She
was conscious that he was looking at her, and
began to scratch with an appearance of charmed
absorption, such as an artist might display in
his work. He watched her for a moment in
silent astonishment and then broke out sharply,</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scratching the bed,&#8221; she responded calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be mad,&#8221; he said, striding angrily
toward her and stretching a hand for the cane.
&#8220;You&#8217;re ruining it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She whipped the cane to the other side, out
of his reach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I?&#8221; she said, turning an eye of fiery
menace on him. &#8220;Maybe I am, and what&#8217;s that
matter?&#8221; Then, turning back to the bed, &#8220;Too
bad, isn&#8217;t it, and the set not paid for yet.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>&#8220;Not paid for!&#8221; he exclaimed, so amazed by
the statement that he forgot everything else.
&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ve given you the money for it twice!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three times,&#8221; she amended coolly, &#8220;and I
spent it on things I liked better. I bought clothes,
and jewelry with it, and little fixings I wanted.
Yes, the bedroom set isn&#8217;t all paid for yet and
we&#8217;ve had it nearly two years. Who would have
thought that the son of Con Ryan didn&#8217;t pay his
bills!&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose, threw the cane into the corner, and,
turning toward him, leaned back, half-sitting on
the foot-board, her hands, palm downward, pressed
on its rounded top. The chandelier was directly
over her head and cast a powerful light on her
face. This was small, pointed, and of that sallow
hue which is often noticeable in the skins of
brunette women who are no longer in their first
youth. She had a nose that drooped a little at
the tip and an upper lip which was long and
closed firmly and secretively on the lower one.
Her dark eyes, large and brilliant, had the
slightest tendency toward a slanting setting, the
outer corners being higher than the inner ones.
Under the shower of light from above, her thick
hair, bleached to a reddish auburn and worn
in a loose knot on top of her head, cast a shadow
over her forehead, and below this her eyes blazed
on her husband. Many men would have thought
her an unusually pretty woman, but no man, save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
one of her own sort, could have faced her at this
moment without quailing.</p>

<p>Dominick and she had had many quarrels,
ignominious and repulsive, but he had never
before seen her in so savage a mood. Even
yet he had not lost the feeling of responsibility
and remorse he felt toward her. As he moved
from the mantelpiece his eye had fallen on the
ball-dress that lay, a sweep of lace and silver,
across the bed, and on the bureau he had seen
jewels and hair ornaments laid out among the
powder boxes and scent bottles. The pathos of
these futile preparations appealed to him and he
made an effort to be patient and just.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a disappointment,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
I&#8217;m sorry about it. But I&#8217;ve done all I could
and there&#8217;s no use doing any more. You&#8217;ve got
to give it up. There&#8217;s no use trying to make
my mother give in. She won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t she?&#8221; she cried, her voice suddenly
loud and shaken with rage. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see! We&#8217;ll
see! We&#8217;ll see if I&#8217;ve married into the Ryan
family for nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her wrath at last loosened, her control was
instantly swept away. In a moment she was
that appalling sight, a violent and vulgar woman
in a raging passion. She ran round the bed and,
seizing the dress, threw it on the floor and stamped
on it, grinding the delicate fabric into the carpet
with her heels.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>&#8220;There!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I feel about
it! That&#8217;s the way I&#8217;ll treat the things and the
people I don&#8217;t like! That dress&mdash;it isn&#8217;t paid for,
but I don&#8217;t want it. I&#8217;ll get another when I do.
Have I married Con Ryan&#8217;s son to need money
and bother about bills? Not on your life! Did
you notice the gas? Every burner turned on.
Well, I did it just to have a nice bright house for
you when you came home without the invitation.
We haven&#8217;t paid the bill for two months&mdash;but
what does that matter? We&#8217;re related to the
Ryans. <i>We</i> don&#8217;t have to trouble about bills.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw that she was beyond arguing with and
turned to leave the room. She sprang after him
and caught him by the arm, pouring out only
too coherent streams of rage and abuse. It was
the old story of the &#8220;wrongs&#8221; she had suffered
at his hands, and his &#8220;ruin&#8221; of her. To-night
it had no power to move him and he shook her
off and left the room. She ran to the door behind
him and leaning out, cried it after him.</p>

<p>He literally fled from her, down the hallway,
with the open doorways sending their lurid light
and hissing noise across his passage. As he
reached the dining-room he heard her bang the
door and with aggressive noise turn the key in
the lock and shoot the bolt. Even at that
moment the lack of necessity for such a precaution
caused a bitter smile to move his lips.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_042.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Her wrath at last loosened, her control was instantly<br /> swept away<span class="gap">      <i>Page <a href="#Page_41">41</a></i></span></p>

<p>He entered the dining-room and sat down by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
the table, his head on his hands. It was very
quiet; no noise came from the street outside,
sinking into the deep restfulness of midnight,
and from within there was only the tearing sound
of the flaring gases and an occasional cool dropping
from the filter in the pantry. He sat thus for
some hours, trying to think what he should do.
He found it impossible to come to any definite
conclusion for the future; all he could decide
upon now was the necessity of leaving his wife,
getting a respite from her, withdrawing himself
from the sight of her. He had never loved her,
but to-night the pity and responsibility he had
felt seemed to be torn from his life as a morning
wind tears a cobweb from the grass.</p>

<p>The dawn was whitening the window-panes
when he finally got pen and paper and wrote a
few lines. These, without prefix or signature,
stated that he would leave the city for a short
time and not to make any effort to find where he
had gone or communicate with him. He wrote
her name on the folded paper and placed it in
front of the clock. Then he stole into his bedroom&mdash;they
had occupied separate rooms for
over six months&mdash;and packed a valise with his
oldest and roughest clothes. After this he waited
in the dining-room till the light was bright and
the traffic of the day loud on the pavement,
before he crept down the long stairway and went
out into the crystal freshness of the morning.</p>

<small>OUT OF NIGHT AND STORM</small></h2>
</div>

<p>When Rose Cannon woke on the morning after
her arrival at Antelope, a memory of the snowflakes
of the evening before made her jump out
of bed and patter barefooted to the window. It
seemed to her it would be &#8220;lots of fun&#8221; to be
snowed up at Antelope, and when she saw only
a thin covering of white on the hotel garden and
the diminishing perspective of roofs, she drew
her mouth into a grimace of disappointment.</p>

<p>With hunched-up shoulders, her hands tucked
under her arms, she stood looking out, her breath
blurring the pane in a dissolving film of smoke.
It was a cold little world. Below her the garden&mdash;the
summer pride of Perley&#8217;s Hotel&mdash;lay a sere,
withered waste, its shrubs stiff in the grip of the
cold. The powdering of snow on its frost-bitten
leaves and grizzled grass added to its air of
bleakness. Beyond rose the shingled roofs of
Antelope&#8217;s main street. From their white-coated
slopes black stovepipes sent aloft spirals of smoke,
a thinner, fainter gray than the air into which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
they ascended. The sky lowered, low-hanging
and full of menace. The snowflakes that now
and then idly circled down were dark against its
stormy pallor. Rose, standing gazing up, wondered
if her father would go on to Greenhide, the
new camp twenty miles from Antelope, where an
important strike had recently been made.</p>

<p>Half an hour later when they met at breakfast
he told her he would not leave for Greenhide
that morning. Perley had warned him not to
attempt it, and he for his part knew the country
well enough to realize that it would be foolhardy
to start under such a threatening sky. It would
be all right to stop over at Antelope till the
weather made up its mind what it meant to do.
It might not be fun for her, but then he had
warned her before they left San Francisco that
she would have to put up with rough accommodations
and unaccustomed discomforts.</p>

<p>Rose laughed. Her father did not understand
that the roughness and novelty of it all was what
she enjoyed. He was already a man of means
when she was born, and she had known nothing
of the hardships and privations through which
he and her mother had struggled up to fortune.
Rocky Bar the night before and Antelope this
morning were her first glimpses of the mining
region over which the pioneers had swarmed in
&#8217;49, Bill Cannon, only a lad in his teens, among
them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>Now she sat sidewise in her chair, sweeping
with animated eyes the primitive dining-room,
its walls whitewashed, its low ceiling hung with
strands of pinked-out, colored paper, its board
floor here and there crossed by strips of cocoanut
matting. At one end a hole in the wall communicated
with the kitchen and through this the
naked arms of the Chinaman, brown against the
uprolled ends of his white sleeves, protruded,
offering dishes to the single waitress who was not
always there to receive them.</p>

<p>The girl, Cora by name, was particularly delinquent
this morning. Several times the Chinaman
was forced to remove his arms and substitute
his face in the opening while he projected an
enraged yell of &#8220;Corla!&#8221; among the hotel guests.
Her dereliction of duty was caused by an overpowering
interest in the Cannons, round whom
she hovered in enchanted observation. On ordinary
occasions Cora was content to wait on the
group of men, local bachelors whose lonely state
made it more convenient for them &#8220;to eat&#8221; at
the hotel, and who sat&mdash;two bending lines of
masculine backs&mdash;at either side of a long table.
Cora&#8217;s usual method was to set the viands before
them and then seat herself at the end of the table
and enliven the meal with light conversation.
To-day, however, they were neglected. She
scarcely answered their salutations, but, banging
the dishes down, hasted away to the Cannon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
table, where she stood fixedly regarding the
strange young lady.</p>

<p>Perley&#8217;s warnings of bad weather were soon
verified. Early in the afternoon the idle, occasional
snowflakes had begun to fall thickly, with
a soft, persistent steadiness of purpose. The icy
stillness of the morning gave place to a wind,
uncertain and whispering at first, but, as the day
advanced, gathering volume and speed. The
office and bar filled with men, some of them&mdash;snow
powdered as if a huge sugar-sifter had been
shaken over them&mdash;having tramped in from small
camps in the vicinity. Clamor and vociferations,
mixed with the smell of strong drinks and damp
woolens, rose from the bar. Constant gusts of
cold air swept the lower passages, and snow was
tramped into the matting round the hall stove.</p>

<p>At four o&#8217;clock, Willoughby, the Englishman
who had charge of the shut-down Bella K. mine,
came, butting head down against the wind, a
group of dogs at his heels, to claim the hospitality
of the hotel. His watchman, an old timer, had
advised him to seek a shelter better stored with
provisions than the office building of the Bella
K. Willoughby, whose accent and manner had
proclaimed him as one of high distinction before
it was known in Antelope that he was &#8220;some
relation to a lord,&#8221; was made welcome in the bar.
His four red setter dogs, shut out from that hospitable
retreat by the swing door, grouped around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
it and stared expectantly, each shout from
within being answered by them with plaintive
and ingratiating whines.</p>

<p>The afternoon was still young when the day
began to darken. Rose Cannon, who had been
sitting in the parlor, dreaming over a fire of logs,
went to the window, wondering at the growing
gloom. The wind had risen to a wild, sweeping
speed, that tore the snow fine as a mist. There
were no lazy, woolly flakes now. They had
turned into an opaque, slanting veil which here
and there curled into snowy mounds and in other
places left the ground bare. It seemed as if a
giant paint-brush, soaked in white, had been
swept over the outlook. Now and then a figure,
head down, hands in pockets, the front of the
body looking as though the paint-brush had been
slapped across it, came into view, shadowy and
unsubstantial in the mist-like density.</p>

<p>Rose looked out on it with an interest that
was a little soberer than the debonair blitheness
of her morning mood. If it kept up they
might be snowed in for days, Perley had said.
That being the case, this room, the hotel&#8217;s one
parlor, would be her retreat, her abiding place&mdash;for
her bedroom was as cold as an ice-chest&mdash;until
they were liberated. With the light, half-whimsical
smile that came so readily to her lips,
she turned from the window and surveyed it
judicially.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>Truly it was not bad. Seen by the light of
the flaming logs pulsing on the obscurity already
lurking in the corners, it had the charm of the
fire-warmed interior, tight-closed against outer
storm. A twilight room lit only by a fire, with
wind and snow outside, is the coziest habitation
in the world. It seemed to Rose it would
make a misanthrope feel friendly, prone to sociable
chat and confidence. When the day grew
still dimmer she would draw the curtains (they
were of a faded green rep) and pull up the old
horsehair arm-chairs that were set back so
demurely in the corners. Her eyes strayed to
the melodeon and then to the wall above it, where
hung a picture of a mining millionaire, once of
the neighborhood, recently deceased, a circlet of
wax flowers from his bier surrounding his head,
and the whole neatly incased in glass. Washington
crossing the Delaware made a pendent
on the opposite wall. On the center-table there
were many books in various stages of unrepair
and in all forms of bindings. These were the
literary aftermath left by the mining men, who,
since the early sixties, had been stopping at
Antelope on their hopeful journeys up and down
the mineral belt.</p>

<p>She was leaving the window to return to her
seat by the fire when the complete silence that
seemed to hold the outside world in a spell was
broken by sudden sounds. Voices, the crack of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
a whip, then a grinding thump against the hotel
porch, caught her ear and whirled her back to
the pane. A large covered vehicle, with the
whitened shapes of a smoking team drooping
before it, had just drawn up at the steps. Two
masculine figures, carrying bags, emerged from
the interior, and from the driver&#8217;s seat a muffled
shape&mdash;a cylinder of wrappings which appeared
to have a lively human core&mdash;gave forth much
loud and profane language. The isolation and
remoteness of her surroundings had already
begun to affect the town-bred young lady. She
ran to the door of the parlor, as ingenuously
curious to see the new arrivals and find out
who they were as though she had lived in Antelope
for a year.</p>

<p>Looking down the hall she saw the front door
open violently inward and two men hastily
enter. The wind seemed to blow them in and
before Perley&#8217;s boy could press the door shut the
snow had whitened the damp matting. No
stage passed through Antelope in these days of
its decline, and the curiosity felt by Rose was
shared by the whole hotel. The swing door to
the bar opened and men pressed into the aperture.
Mrs. Perley came up from the kitchen,
wiping a dish. Cora appeared in the dining-room
doorway, and in answer to Miss Cannon&#8217;s inquiringly-lifted
eyebrows, called across the hall:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Murphysville stage on the down-trip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
to Rocky Bar. I guess they thought they
couldn&#8217;t make it. The driver don&#8217;t like to run
no risks and so he&#8217;s brought &#8217;em round this way
and dumped &#8217;em here. There ain&#8217;t but two passengers.
That&#8217;s them.&#8221;</p>

<p>She indicated the two men who, standing by the
hall stove, were divesting themselves of their
wraps. One of them was a tall upright old
man with a sweep of grizzled beard covering
his chest, and gray hair falling from the dome of
a bald head.</p>

<p>The other was much younger, tall also, and
spare to leanness. He wore a gray fedora hat,
and against its chill, unbecoming tint, his face,
its prominent, bony surfaces nipped by the cold
to a raw redness, looked sallow and unhealthy.
With an air of solicitude he laid his overcoat
across a chair, brushing off the snow with a careful
hand. Buttoned tight in a black cutaway
with the collar turned up about his neck, he had
an appearance of being uncomfortably compressed
into garments too small for him. His shiny-knuckled,
purplish hands, pinching up the shoulders
of his coat over the chair-back, were in keeping
with his general suggestion of a large-boned
meagerly-covered lankness. The fact that he
was smooth-shaven, combined with the unusual
length of dark hair that appeared below his hat-brim,
lent him a suggestion of something interestingly
unconventional, almost artistic. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
region where he now found himself he would
have been variously set down as a gambler, a
traveling clergyman, an actor, or perhaps only a
vender of patent medicines who had some odd,
attractive way of advertising himself, such as
drawing teeth with an electric appliance, or playing
the guitar from the tail-board of his showman&#8217;s
cart.</p>

<p>Now, having arranged his coat to its best
advantage, he turned to Perley and said with a
curiously deep and resonant voice,</p>

<p>&#8220;And, mine host, a stove in my bedroom, a
stove in my bedroom or I perish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cora giggled and threw across the hall to Miss
Cannon a delighted murmur of,</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, say, ain&#8217;t he just the richest thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got us trapped and caged here for
a spell, I guess,&#8221; said the older man. &#8220;Any one
else in the same box?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll not want for company,&#8221; said
Perley, pride at the importance of the announcement
vibrating in his tone. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got Willoughby
here from the Bella K. with his four setter
dogs, and Bill Cannon and his daughter up from
the coast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill Cannon!&#8221;&mdash;the two men stared and the
younger one said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill Cannon, the Bonanza King from San
Francisco?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s him all right,&#8221; nodded Perley. &#8220;Up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
here to see the diggings at Greenhide and snowed
in same as you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here, Rose, fearing the conversation might turn
upon herself, slipped from the doorway into the
passage and up the stairs to her own room.</p>

<p>An hour later as she stood before the glass
making her toilet for supper, a knock at the door
ushered in Cora, already curled, powdered and
beribboned for that occasion, a small kerosene
lamp in her hand. In the bare room, its gloom
only partly dispelled by the light from a similar
lamp on the bureau and the red gleam from the
stove, Miss Cannon was revealed in the becoming
half-dusk made by these imperfectly-blending
illuminations, a pink silk dressing-gown loosely
enfolding her, a lightly brushed-in suggestion of
fair hair behind her ears and on her shoulders.
Her comb was in her hand and Cora realized with
an uplifting thrill that she had timed her visit
correctly and was about to learn the mysteries
of Miss Cannon&#8217;s coiffure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I brung you another lamp,&#8221; she said affably,
setting her offering down on the bureau. &#8220;One
ain&#8217;t enough light to dress decently by. I have
three,&#8221; and she sank down on the side of the bed
with the air of having established an intimacy,
woman to woman, by this act of generous consideration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Them gentlemen,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;are along
on this hall with you and your pa. The old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
one&#8217;s Judge Washburne, of Colusa, a pioneer that
used to know Mrs. Perley&#8217;s mother way back in
Sacramento in the fifties, and knew your pa real
well when he was poor. It&#8217;s sort of encouraging
to think <i>your</i> pa was ever poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose laughed and turned sidewise, looking at
the speaker under the arch of her uplifted arm.
There were hair-pins in her mouth and an
upwhirled end of blond hair protruded in a
gleaming scattering of yellow over her forehead.
She mumbled a comment on her father&#8217;s early
poverty, her lips showing red against the hair-pins
nipped between her teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the other one,&#8221; went on Cora, her eyes
riveted on the hair-dressing, her subconscious
mind making notes of the disposition of every
coil, &#8220;his name&#8217;s J. D. Buford. And I&#8217;d like
you to guess what he is! An actor, a stage
player. He&#8217;s been playing all up the state from
Los Angeles and was going down to Sacramento
to keep an engagement there. It just tickles me
to death to have an actor in the house. I ain&#8217;t
never seen one close to before.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last hair-pin was adjusted and Miss Cannon
studied the effect with a hand-glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;An actor,&#8221; she commented, running a smoothing
palm up the back of her head, &#8220;that&#8217;s just
what he looked like, now I think of it. Perhaps
he&#8217;ll act for us. I think it&#8217;s going to be lots of
fun being snowed up at Antelope.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>The sound of a voice crying &#8220;Cora&#8221; here rose
from the hallway and that young woman, with a
languid deliberation of movement, as of one who
obeys a vulgar summons at her own elegant
leisure, rose and departed, apologizing for having
to go so soon. A few minutes later, the hour of
supper being at hand, Rose followed her.</p>

<p>She was descending the stairs when a commotion
from below, a sound of voices loud, argumentative,
rising and falling in excited chorus,
hurried her steps. The lower hall, lit with lamps
and the glow of its stove, heated to a translucent
red, was full of men. A current of cold could
be felt in the hot atmosphere and fresh snow
was melting on the floor. Standing by the stove
was a man who had evidently just entered.
Ridges of white lay caught in the folds of his
garments; a silver hoar was on his beard. He
held his hands out to the heat and as Rose reached
the foot of the stairs she heard him say,</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I tell you that any man that started
to walk up here from Rocky Bar this afternoon
must have been plumb crazy. Why, John L.
Sullivan couldn&#8217;t do it in such a storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>To which the well-bred voice of Willoughby
answered,</p>

<p>&#8220;But according to the message he started at
two and the snow was hardly falling then. He
must have got a good way, past the Silver
Crescent even, when the storm caught him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>A hubbub of voices broke out here, and, seeing
her father on the edge of the crowd, Rose went
to him and plucked his sleeve, murmuring,</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened? What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</p>

<p>He took his cigar out of his mouth and turned
toward her, speaking low and keeping his eyes on
the men by the stove.</p>

<p>&#8220;The telegraph operator&#8217;s just had a message
sent from Rocky Bar that a man started from
there this afternoon to walk up here. They
don&#8217;t think he could make it and are afraid he&#8217;s
lost somewhere. Perley and some of the boys are
going out to look for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a dreadful thing! In such a storm!
Do you think they&#8217;ll ever find him?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrugged, and replaced his cigar in his
mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess so. If he was strong enough to
get on near here they ought to. But it&#8217;s just
what the operator says. The feller must have
been plumb crazy to attempt such a thing.
Looks as if he was a stranger in the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a sort of quiet, respectable way of committing
suicide,&#8221; said the voice of the actor
behind them.</p>

<p>Rose looked over her shoulder and saw his
thin, large-featured face, no longer nipped and
reddened with cold, but wreathed in an obsequious
and friendly smile which furrowed it with
deep lines. Her father answered him and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
turned away, being more interested in the preparations
for the search party. As she watched
these she could hear the desultory conversation
behind her, the actor&#8217;s comments delivered with
an unctuous, elaborate politeness which, contrasted
with her father&#8217;s gruff brevity, made her
smile furtively to herself.</p>

<p>A jingle of sleigh bells from without threw the
party into the sudden bustle of departure. Men
shrugged themselves into their coats and tied
comforters over their ears. Perley emerged from
the bar, shrouded in outer wrappings, and crowding
a whisky flask into his pocket. The hall
door was thrown open, and through the powdery
thickness of the atmosphere the sleigh with its
restive horses could be seen drawn up at the
porch steps. Those left behind pressed into the
doorway to speed the departure. Shouted
instructions, last suggestions as to the best methods
for conducting the search filled the air, drowning
the despairing whines that Willoughby&#8217;s dogs,
shut in the bar, sent after their master. With
a broken jingle of bells the sleigh started and in
a moment was swallowed up in the blackness of
the storm.</p>

<p>Supper was an animated meal that evening.
The suddenly tragic interest that had developed
drew the little group of guests together with the
strands of a common sympathy. The judge
and the actor moved their seats to the Cannons&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
table. Cora was sent to request the doctor&mdash;a
young man fresh from his graduation in San
Francisco who took his meals at the bachelor&#8217;s
table&mdash;to join them and add the weight of medical
opinion to their surmises as to the traveler&#8217;s
chances of survival. These, the doctor thought,
depended as much upon the man&#8217;s age and physical
condition, as upon the search party&#8217;s success
in finding him. And then they speculated as to
the man himself, drawing inferences from the one
thing they knew of him, building up his character
from this single fact, deducing from it what manner
of man he should be, and why he should have
done so strangely foolhardy a thing.</p>

<p>After supper they retired to the parlor, piled
the fire high and sat grouped before it, the smoke
of cigars and cigarettes lying about their heads
in white layers. It was but natural that the
conversation should turn on stories of the great
storms of the past. Rose had heard many such
before, but to-night, with the wind rocking the
old hotel and the thought of the lost man heavy
at her heart, she listened, held in a cold clutch
of fascinated attention, to tales of the emigrants
caught in the passes of the Sierra, of pioneer
mining-camps relieved by mule trains which broke
through the snow blockade as the miners lay
dying in their huts, of men risking their lives to
carry succor to comrades lost in their passage
from camp to camp on just such a night as this.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Now and then one of Willoughby&#8217;s dogs, long
since broken from the confinement of the bar,
came to the door and put in an inquiring head,
the ears pricked, the eyes full of hopeful inquiry,
a feathered tail wagging in deprecating friendliness.
But its master was not there and it turned
away, disappointed, to run up the hall, sniffing
under closed doors and whimpering in uneasy
loneliness.</p>

<p>Rose sat crouched over the fire, and as the fund
of stories became exhausted and silence gradually
settled on the group, her thoughts turned again
to the traveler. She had been shocked at first,
as the others were, by the thought of a fellow
creature lost in the storm; but as the evening
advanced, and the talk threw round his vague,
undefined figure the investiture of an identity
and a character, she began to see him less as a
nebulous, menaced shape than as a known
individuality. He seemed to be advancing out
of the swirling blackness of the night into extending
circles of the acquainted and the intimate.
He was drawing near, drawing out of the limbo
of darkness and mystery, into the light of their
friendly fire, the grasp of their welcoming hands.
He took shape in her imagination; she began to
see his outline forming and taking color. With
every tick of the clock she felt more keenly that
he was some one who needed her help, and whom
she must rescue. By ten she was in a ferment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
of anguished expectancy. The lost traveler was
to her a man who had once been her friend, now
threatened by death.</p>

<p>The clock hand passed ten, and the periods of
silence that at intervals had fallen on the watchers
grew longer and more frequent, and finally merged
into a stillness where all sat motionless, listening
to the storm. It had increased with the coming
of the dark and now filled the night with wildness
and tumult. The wind made human sounds about
the angles of the house, which rocked and creaked
to its buffets. The gale was fitful. It died away
almost to silence, seeming to recuperate its forces
for a new attack, and then came back full of
fresh energies. It struck blows on the doors and
windows, like those of a fist demanding entrance.
Billowing rushes of sound circled round the
building, and then a rustling passage of sleet
swept across the curtained pane.</p>

<p>It was nearly eleven, and for fifteen minutes no
one had spoken a word. Two of the dogs had
come in and lain down on the hearth-rug, their
noses on their paws, their eyes fixed brightly and
ponderingly on the fire. In the midst of the
motionless semicircle one of them suddenly
raised its head, its ears pricked. With its muzzle
elevated, its eyes full of awakened intelligence,
it gave a low, uneasy whimper. Almost simultaneously
Rose started and drew herself up,
exclaiming, &#8220;Listen!&#8221; The sound of sleigh bells,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
faint as a noise in a dream, came through the
night.</p>

<p>In a moment the lower floor was shaken with
movement and noise. The bar emptied itself on
to the porch and the hall doors were thrown wide.
The sleigh had been close to the hotel before its
bells were heard, and almost immediately its
shape emerged from the swirling whiteness and
drew up at the steps. Rose, standing back in
the parlor doorway, heard a clamor of voices,
a rising surge of sound from which no intelligible
sentence detached itself, and a thumping and
stamping of feet as the searchers staggered in
with the lost traveler. The crowd separated
before them and they entered slowly, four men
carrying a fifth, their bodies incrusted with snow,
the man they bore an unseen shape covered with
whitened rugs from which an arm hung, a limp
hand touching the floor. Questions and answers,
now clear and sharp, followed them, like notes
upon the text of the inert form:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d you get him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About five miles below on the main road.
One of the horses almost stepped on him. He
was right in the path, but he was all sprinkled
over with snow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not dead, is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty near, I guess. We&#8217;ve pumped whisky
into him, but he ain&#8217;t shown a sign of life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>&#8220;Search me. I ain&#8217;t seen him good myself
yet. Just as we got him the lantern went out.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a sofa in the hall and they laid their
burden there, the crowd edging in on them,
horrified, interested, hungrily peering. Rose could
see their bent, expressive backs and the craning
napes of their necks. Then a sharp order from the
doctor drove them back, sheepish, tramping on
one another&#8217;s toes, bunched against the wall and
still avidly staring. As their ranks broke, the
young girl had a sudden, vivid glimpse of the
man, his head and part of his chest uncovered.
Her heart gave a leap of pity and she made a
movement from the doorway, then stopped. The
lost traveler, that an hour before had almost
assumed the features of a friend, was a complete
stranger that she had never seen before.</p>

<p>He looked like a dead man. His face, the chin
up, the lips parted under the fringe of a brown
mustache, was marble white, and showed a gray
shadow in the cheek. The hair on his forehead,
thawed by the heat, was lying in damp half-curled
semicircles, dark against the pallid skin. There
was a ring on the hand that still hung limp
on the floor. The doctor, muttering to himself,
pulled open the shirt and was feeling the
heart, when Perley, who had flown into the bar
for more whisky, emerged, a glass in his hand.
As his eye fell upon the man, he stopped, stared,
and then exclaimed in loud-voiced amaze:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>&#8220;My God&mdash;why, it&#8217;s Dominick Ryan! Look
here, Governor&#8221;&mdash;to Cannon who was standing
by his daughter in the parlor doorway, &#8220;come
and see for yourself. If this ain&#8217;t young Ryan
I&#8217;m a Dutchman!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cannon pushed between the intervening men
and bent over the prostrate figure.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s who it is,&#8221; he said slowly and unemotionally.
&#8220;It&#8217;s Dominick Ryan, all right. Well,
by ginger!&#8221; and he turned and looked at the
amazed innkeeper, &#8220;that&#8217;s the queerest thing I
ever saw. What&#8217;s brought him up here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Perley, his glass snatched from him by the
doctor who seemed entirely indifferent to their
recognition of his patient, shrugged helplessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blest if I know,&#8221; he said, staring aimlessly
about him. &#8220;He was here last summer fishing.
But there ain&#8217;t no fishing now. God, ain&#8217;t it
a good thing that operator at Rocky Bar had the
sense to telegraph up!&#8221;</p>

<small>NURSE AND PATIENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>When Dominick returned to consciousness
he lay for a space looking directly in front of him,
then moved his head and let his eyes sweep the
walls. They were alien walls of white plaster,
naked of all adornment. The light from a shaded
lamp lay across one of them in a soft yet clear
wash of yellow, so clear that he could see that the
plaster was coarse.</p>

<p>There were few pieces of furniture in the room,
and all new to him. A bureau of the old-fashioned
marble-topped kind stood against the wall opposite.
The lamp that cast the yellow light was on
this bureau; its globe, a translucent gold reflection
revealed in liquid clearness in the mirror just
behind. It was not his own room nor Berny&#8217;s.
He turned his head farther on the pillow very
slowly, for he seemed sunk in an abyss of suffering
and feebleness. On the table by the bed&#8217;s head
was another lamp, a folded newspaper shutting
its light from his face, and here his eyes stopped.</p>

<p>A woman was sitting by the foot of the bed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
her head bent as if reading. He stared at her
with even more intentness than he had at the
room. The glow of the lamp on the bureau was
behind her&mdash;he saw her against it without color
or detail, like a shadow thrown on a sheet. Her
outlines were sharply defined against the illumined
stretch of plaster,&mdash;the arch of her head, which was
broken by the coils of hair on top, her rather
short neck, with some sort of collar binding it,
the curve of her shoulders, rounded and broad, not
the shoulders of a thin woman. He did not think
she was his wife, but she might be, and he moved
and said suddenly in a husky voice,</p>

<p>&#8220;What time is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman started, laid her book down, and
rose. She came forward and stood beside him,
looking down, the filaments of hair round her head
blurring the sharpness of its outline. He stared up
at her, haggard and intent, and saw it was not his
wife. It was a strange woman with a pleasant,
smiling face. He felt immensely relieved and said
with a hoarse carefulness of utterance,</p>

<p>&#8220;What time did you say it is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A few minutes past five,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve been asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I?&#8221; he said, gazing immovably at her.
&#8220;What day is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thursday,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;You came here
last night from Rocky Bar. Perhaps you don&#8217;t
remember.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>&#8220;Rocky Bar!&#8221; he repeated vaguely, groping
through a haze of memory. &#8220;Was it only yesterday?
Was it only yesterday I left San Francisco?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know when you left San Francisco&mdash;&#8221;
the newspaper shade cracked and bent a little,
letting a band of light fall across the pillow. She
leaned down, arranging it with careful hands,
looking from the light to him to see if it were
correctly adjusted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whenever you left San Francisco,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;you got here last night. They brought you
here, Perley and some other men in the sleigh.
They found you in the road. You were half-frozen.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her moving hands, then when they
had satisfactorily arranged the shade and dropped
to her sides, he looked at her face. Her eyes
were soft and friendly and had a gentle, kind
expression. He liked to look at them. The only
woman&#8217;s eyes he had looked into lately had been
full of wrathful lightenings. There seemed no
need to be polite or do the things that people did
when they were well and sitting talking in chairs,
so he did not speak for what seemed to him a long
time. Then he said,</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Antelope,&#8221; said the woman. &#8220;Perley&#8217;s Hotel
at Antelope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he answered with an air of weary
recollection, &#8220;I was going to walk there from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
Rocky Bar, but the snow came down too hard,
and the wind&mdash;you could hardly stand against it!
It was a terrible pull. Perley&#8217;s Hotel at Antelope.
Of course, I know all about it. I was here last
summer for two weeks fishing.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stretched out her hand for a glass, across the
top of which a book rested. He followed the
movement with a mute fixity.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is your medicine,&#8221; she said, taking the
book off the glass. &#8220;You were to take it at five
but I didn&#8217;t like to wake you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She dipped a spoon into the glass and held it out
to him. But the young man felt too ill to bother
with medicine and, as the spoon touched his lips,
he gave his head a slight jerk and the liquid was
spilt on the counterpane. She looked at it for a
rueful moment, then said, as if with gathering
determination,</p>

<p>&#8220;But you <i>must</i> take it. I think perhaps I gave
it wrong. I ought to have lifted you up. It&#8217;s
easier that way,&#8221; and before he could answer she
slipped her arm under his head and raised it, with
the other hand setting the rim of the glass against
his lips. He swallowed a mouthful and felt her
arm sliding from behind his head. He had a hazy
consciousness that a perfume came from her dress,
and for the first time he wondered who she was.
Wondering thus, his eyes again followed her hand
putting back the glass, and watched it, white in
the gush of lamplight, carefully replacing the book.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
Then she turned toward him with the same slight,
soft smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are <i>you</i>?&#8221; he said, keeping his hollowed
eyes hard on her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Rose Cannon,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Rose
Cannon from San Francisco.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; with a movement of comprehension,
the name striking a chord of memory. &#8220;Rose
Cannon from San Francisco, daughter of Bill
Cannon. Of course I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent again, overwhelmed by indifference
and lassitude. She made a step backward
from the bedside. Her dress rustled and the same
faint perfume he had noticed came delicately to
him. He turned his head away from her and said
dryly and without interest,</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought it was some one else.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words seemed to arrest her. She came back
and stood close beside him. Looking up he could
see her head against the light that ran up from the
shaded lamps along the ceiling. She bent down
and said, speaking slowly and clearly as though
to a child,</p>

<p>&#8220;The storm has broken the wires but as soon
as they are up, papa will send your mother word,
so you needn&#8217;t worry about that. But we don&#8217;t
either of us know your wife&#8217;s address. If you
could tell us&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped. He had begun to frown and then
shut his eyes with an expression of weariness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t bother
about it. Let her alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again there was one of those pauses which
seemed to him so long. He gave a sigh and
moved restlessly, and she said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Are your feet very painful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, pretty bad,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;What&#8217;s
the matter with them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were frost-bitten, one partly frozen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;&#8221; he did not seem profoundly interested.
It was as if they were some one else&#8217;s feet, only
they hurt violently enough to obtrude themselves
upon his attention. &#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221;
he added. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be all right to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt very tired and heard, as in a dream, the
rustle of her dress as she moved again. She said
something about &#8220;supper&#8221; and &#8220;Mrs. Perley
coming,&#8221; and the dark, enveloping sense of stupor
from which he had come to life closed on him
again.</p>

<p>Some time later on he emerged from it and saw
another woman, stout and matronly, with sleekly-parted
hair, and an apron girt about her. He
asked her, too, who she was, for the fear that he
might wake and find his wife by his bedside
mingled with the pain of his feet, to torment him
and break the vast, dead restfulness of the torpor
in which he lay.</p>

<p>It broke into gleams of interest and returning
consciousness during the next two days. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
experienced an acuter sense of illness and pain,
the burning anguish of his feet and fevered
misery of his body, bitten through with cold,
brought him back to a realization of his own
identity. He heard the doctor murmuring in the
corner of &#8220;threatened pneumonia&#8221; and understood
that he was the object threatened. He
began to know and separate the strange faces that
seemed continually to be bending over him, asking
him how he felt. There was the doctor, Perley,
Bill Cannon, and the old judge and three different
women, whom he had some difficulty in keeping
from merging into one composite being who was
sometimes &#8220;Miss Cannon,&#8221; and sometimes &#8220;Mrs.
Perley,&#8221; and then again &#8220;Cora.&#8221;</p>

<p>When on the fourth day the doctor told him
that he thought he would &#8220;pull through&#8221; with
no worse ailment than a frozen foot, he had
regained enough of his original vigor and impatience
under restraint to express a determination
to rise and &#8220;go on.&#8221; He was in pain, mental
and physical, and the ministrations and attentions
of the satellites that so persistently revolved
round his bed rasped him into irritable moodiness.
He did not know that all Antelope was waiting
for the latest bulletins from Mrs. Perley or Cora.
The glamour attaching to his sensational entry into
their midst had been intensified by the stories of
the wealth and position that had been his till he
had married a poor girl, contrary to his mother&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
wishes. He was talked of in the bar, discussed
in the kitchen, and Cora dreamed of him at night.
The very name of Ryan carried its weight, and
Antelope, a broken congeries of white roofs and
black smoke-stacks emerging from giant drifts,
throbbed with pride at the thought that the two
greatest names of California finance were snow-bound
in Perley&#8217;s Hotel.</p>

<p>The doctor laughed at his desire to &#8220;move on.&#8221;
The storm was still raging and Antelope was as
completely cut off from the rest of the world as if it
were an uncharted island in the unknown reaches
of the Pacific. Propping the invalid up among
his pillows he drew back the curtain and let him
look out through a frost-painted pane on a world
all sweeping lines and skurrying eddies of white.
The drifts curled crisp edges over the angles of
roofs, like the lips of breaking waves. The
glimpse of the little town that the window
afforded showed it cowering under a snow blanket,
almost lost to sight in its folds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even if your feet were all right, you&#8217;re tied
here for two weeks anyway,&#8221; said the doctor,
dropping the curtain. &#8220;It&#8217;s the biggest storm <i>I</i>
ever saw, and there&#8217;s an old timer that hangs
round the bar who says it&#8217;s as bad as the one that
caught the Donner party in forty-six.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day it stopped and the world lay
gleaming and still under a frosty crust. The sky
was a cold, sullen gray, brooding and cloud-hung,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
and the roofs and tree-tops stood out against it as
though executed in thick white enamel. The
drifts lay in suave curves, softly undulating like
the outlines of a woman&#8217;s body, sometimes sweeping
smoothly up to second stories, here and there
curdled into an eddy, frozen as it twisted. A
miner came in from an outlying camp on skees and
reported the cold as intense, the air clear as
crystal and perfectly still. On the path as he
came numerous fir boughs had broken under the
weight of snow, with reports like pistol shots.
There was a rumor that men, short of provisions,
were snowed up at the Yaller Dog mine just
beyond the shoulder of the mountain. This gave
rise to much consultation and loud talking in the
bar, and the lower floor of Perley&#8217;s was as full of
people, noise and stir, as though a party were in
progress.</p>

<p>That afternoon Dominick, clothed in an old
bath-robe of the doctor&#8217;s, his swathed feet hidden
under a red rug drawn from Mrs. Perley&#8217;s stores,
was promoted to an easy chair by the window.
The doctor, who had helped him dress, having
disposed the rug over his knees and tucked a
pillow behind his back, stood off and looked
critically at the effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to have you look your best,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and you&#8217;ve got to act your prettiest this afternoon.
The young lady&#8217;s coming in to take care of
you while I go my rounds.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>&#8220;Young lady!&#8221; exclaimed Dominick in a tone
that indicated anything but pleasurable anticipation.
&#8220;What young lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Our</i> young lady,&#8221; answered the doctor. &#8220;Miss
Cannon, the Young Lady of Perley&#8217;s Hotel.
Don&#8217;t you know that that&#8217;s the nicest girl in the
world? Maybe you don&#8217;t, but that&#8217;s because
your powers of appreciation have been dormant
for the last few days. The people here were
most scared to death of her at first. They didn&#8217;t
know how she was going to get along, used to the
finest, the way she&#8217;s always been. But, bless your
heart, she&#8217;s less trouble than anybody in the
place. There&#8217;s twelve extra people eating here,
besides you to be looked after, and Mrs. Perley
and Cora are pretty near run to death trying to do
it. Miss Cannon wanted to turn in and help them.
They wouldn&#8217;t have it, but they had to let her do
her turn here taking care of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very kind of her,&#8221; said the invalid without
enthusiasm. &#8220;I noticed her here several times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And as easy as an old shoe,&#8221; said the doctor.
&#8220;Just as nice to Perley&#8217;s boy, who&#8217;s a waif that
the Perleys picked up in the streets of Stockton,
as if he was the Prince of Wales. I tell you
heredity&#8217;s a queer thing. How did Bill Cannon
come to have a girl like that? Of course there&#8217;s
the mother to take into account, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A knock on the door interrupted him. To his
cry of &#8220;Come in,&#8221; Rose entered, a white shawl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
over her shoulders, a book in her hand. While
she and Dominick were exchanging greetings, the
doctor began thrusting his medicines into his bag,
alleging the necessity of an immediate departure,
as two cases of bronchitis and three of pneumonia
awaited him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t know there were that many people
in Antelope,&#8221; he said as he snapped the clasp of
the bag and picked up his hat. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll swear
to it, even if it does seem the prejudiced estimate
of an old inhabitant. So long. I&#8217;ll be back by
five and I hope to hear a good report from the
nurse.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door closed behind him and Dominick and
the young girl were left looking rather blankly at
each other. It was the first time he had seen
her when he had not been presented to her
observation as a prostrate and fever-stricken
sufferer of whom nothing was expected but a
docile attitude in the matter of medicines. Now
he felt the subjugating power of clothes. It did
not seem possible that the doctor&#8217;s bath-robe and
Mrs. Perley&#8217;s red rug could cast such a blighting
weight of constraint and consciousness upon him.
But with the donning of them his invalid irresponsibility
seemed gone for ever. He had a
hunted, helpless feeling that he ought to talk to
this young woman as gentlemen did who were not
burdened by the pain of frozen feet and marital
troubles. Moreover, he felt the annoyance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
being thus thrust upon the care of a lady whom
he hardly knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry that they bothered you this
way,&#8221; he said awkwardly. &#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&#8217;t think
I need any one with me. I&#8217;m quite comfortable
here by myself,&#8221; and then he stopped, conscious
of the ungraciousness of his words, and reddening
uncomfortably.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say you don&#8217;t want me here,&#8221; said Rose
with an air of meekness which had the effect of
being assumed. &#8220;But you really have been too
sick to be left alone. Besides, there&#8217;s your medicine,
you must take that regularly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The invalid gave an indifferent cast of his eye
toward the glass on the bureau, guarded by the
familiar book and spoon. Then he looked back
at her. She was regarding him deprecatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t I take it myself?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d trust you,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>His sunken glance was held by hers, and he saw,
under the deprecation of her look, humor struggling
to keep itself in seemly suppression. He was
faintly surprised. There did not seem to him
anything comic in the fact of her distrust. But
as he looked at her he saw the humor rising past
control. She dropped her eyes to hide it and bit
her under lip. This did strike him as funny and
a slow grin broke the melancholy of his face.
She stole a stealthy look at him, her gravity
vanished at the first glimpse of the grin, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
began to laugh, holding her head down and
making the stifled, chuckling sounds of controlled
mirth suddenly liberated. He was amused and
a little puzzled and, with his grin more pronounced
than before, said,</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you laughing at?&#8221;</p>

<p>She lifted her head and looked at him with
eyes narrowed to slits, murmuring,</p>

<p>&#8220;You, trying to get rid of me and being so
polite and helpless. It&#8217;s too pathetic for words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s pathetic, why do you laugh?&#8221; he said,
laughing himself, he did not know why.</p>

<p>She made no immediate reply and he looked at
her, languidly interested and admiring. For the
first time he realized that she was a pretty girl,
with her glistening coils of blond hair and a
pearl-white skin, just now suffused with pink.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you think I wanted to get rid of
you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve almost said so,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;And
then&mdash;well, I can see you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How? What have I done that you&#8217;ve seen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not any especial thing, but&mdash;I <i>think</i> you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt too weak and indifferent to tell polite
falsehoods. Leaning his head on the pillow that
stood up at his back, he said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I did at first. But now I&#8217;m glad
you came.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled indulgently at him as though he
were a sick child.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>&#8220;I should think you wouldn&#8217;t have wanted
me. You must be so tired of people coming in
and out. Those days when you were so bad
the doctor had the greatest difficulty in keeping
men out who didn&#8217;t know you and had never
seen you. Everybody in the hotel wanted to
crowd in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did they want to do that for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To see you. <i>We</i> were the sensation of Antelope
first. But then you came and put us completely
in the shade. Antelope hasn&#8217;t had such
an excitement as your appearance since the death
of Jim Granger, whose picture is down stairs in
the parlor and who comes from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why I should be an excitement.
When I was up here fishing last summer nobody
was in the least excited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the way you came&mdash;half-dead out of
the night as if the sea had thrown you up. Then
everybody wanted to know why you did it, why
you, a Californian, attempted such a dangerous
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t anything so desperately dangerous
about it,&#8221; he said, almost in a tone of sulky
protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;The men down stairs seemed to think so.
They say nobody could have got up here in such
a storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, rubbish! Besides, it wasn&#8217;t storming when
I left Rocky Bar. It was gray and threatening,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
but there wasn&#8217;t a flake falling. The first snow
came down when I was passing the Silver
Crescent. It came very fast after that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you do it&mdash;attempt to walk such a
distance in such uncertain weather?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dominick smoothed the rug over his knees.
His face, looking down, had a curious expression
of cold, enforced patience.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was tired,&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;I&#8217;d worked
too hard and I thought the mountains would do
me good. I can get time off at the bank when
I want and I thought I&#8217;d take a holiday and
come up here where I was last summer.
I knew the place and liked the hotel. I wanted
to get a good way off, out of the city and
away from my work. As for walking up here
that afternoon&mdash;I&#8217;m very strong and I never
thought for a moment such a blizzard was coming
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lifted his head and turned toward the
window, then raising one hand rubbed it across
his forehead and eyes. There was something in
the gesture that silenced the young girl. She
thought he felt tired and had been talking too
much and she was guiltily conscious of her
laughter and loquacity.</p>

<p>They sat without speaking for some moments.
Dominick made no attempt to break the silence
when she moved noiselessly to the stove and
pushed in more wood. His face was turned from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
her and she thought he had fallen asleep when
he suddenly moved and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it strange that I have never met you
before?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was relieved. His tone showed neither
feebleness nor fatigue, in fact it had the fresh
alertness of a return to congenial topics. She
determined, however, to be less talkative, less
encouraging to the weakening exertions of general
conversation. So she spoke with demure brevity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, very. But you were at college for four
years, and the year you came back I was in
Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her ruminatingly, and nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve seen you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;at the theater.
I was too sick at first to recognize you, but afterward
I knew I&#8217;d seen you, with your father and
your brother Gene.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was her turn to nod. She thought it best
to say nothing, and waited. But his eyes bent
inquiringly upon her, and the waiting silence
seemed to demand a comment. She made the
first one that occurred to her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom were <i>you</i> with?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife,&#8221; said the young man.</p>

<p>Rose felt that an indefinite silence would have
been better than this. All she knew of Dominick
Ryan&#8217;s wife was that she was a person who had
not been respectable and whose union with
Dominick had estranged him from his people.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Certainly, whatever else she was, young Mrs.
Ryan was not calculated to be an agreeable subject
of converse with the man who in marrying
her had sacrificed wealth, family, and friends.
The doctor&#8217;s chief injunction to Rose had been
to keep the invalid in a state of tranquillity.
Oppressed by a heavy sense of failure she felt
that nursing was not her forte.</p>

<p>She murmured a vague sentence of comment
and this time determined not to speak, no matter
how embarrassing the pause became. She even
thought of taking up her book and was about
to stretch her hand for it, when he said,</p>

<p>&#8220;But it seems so queer when our parents have
been friends for years, and I know Gene, and you
know my sister Cornelia so well.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew her hand back and leaned forward,
frowning and staring in front of her, as she sent
her memory backward groping for data.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see a sort of series of events prevented
it. When we were little our parents
lived in different places. Ages ago when we first
came down from Virginia City you were living
somewhere else, in Sacramento, wasn&#8217;t it? Then
you were at school, and after that you went East
to college for four years, and when you got back
from college I was in Europe. And when I
came back from Europe&mdash;that&#8217;s over two years
ago now&mdash;why then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She had again brought up against his marriage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
this time with a shock that was of a somewhat
shattering nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then,&#8221; she repeated falteringly, realizing
where she was&mdash;&#8220;why, then&mdash;let&#8217;s see&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I had married,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, of course,&#8221; she assented, trying to
impart a suggestion of sudden innocent remembrance
to her tone. &#8220;You had married. Why,
of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>He vouchsafed no reply. She was distressed
and mortified, her face red with anger at her
own stupidity. In her embarrassment she looked
down, smoothing her lace cuffs, and waiting for
him to say something as he had done before.
But this time he made no attempt to resume the
conversation. Stealing a sidelong glance at him
she saw that he had turned to the window and
was gazing out. There was an expression of
brooding gloom on his profile, his eyebrows
drawn low, his lips close set. She judged rightly
that he did not intend to speak again, and she
took up her book and opened it.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, rising to give him his medicine,
she saw that he had fallen asleep. She was
at his side before she discovered it, thinking his
eyes were drooped in thought. Standing with
the glass in her hand she looked at him with
something of a child&#8217;s shrinking curiosity and a
woman&#8217;s pity for a strong creature weakened
and brought low. The light in the room was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
growing gray and in it she saw his face, with the
shadows in its hollows, looking thin and haggard
in the abandonment of sleep. For the first time,
seeing him clothed and upright, she realized that
he was a personable man, a splendid man, and
also for the first time she thought of him outside
this room and this house, and a sort of proud
resentment stirred in her at the memory of the
marriage he had made&mdash;the marriage with the
woman who was not good.</p>

<p>An hour later when the doctor came back she
was kneeling on the floor by the open stove door,
softly building up the fire. From the orifice&mdash;a
circle of brilliance in the dim room&mdash;a red glow
painted her serious, down-bent face with a hectic
color, and touched with a bright, palpitating glaze
the curves of her figure. At the sound of the
opening door she looked up quickly, and, her
hands being occupied, gave a silencing jerk of
her head toward the sleeping man.</p>

<p>The doctor looked at them both. The scene
was like a picture of some primitive domestic
interior where youth and beauty had made a
nest, warmed by that symbol of life, a fire, which
one replenished while the other slept.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>IN WHICH BERNY WRITES A LETTER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The morning after the quarrel Bernice woke
late. She had not fallen asleep till the night was
well spent, the heated seething of her rage keeping
the peace of repose far from her. It was only as
the dawn paled the square of the window that she
fell into a heavy slumber, disturbed by dreams
full of stress and strife.</p>

<p>She looked up at the clock; it was nearly ten.
Dominick would have left for the bank before this,
so the wretched constraint of a meeting with him
was postponed. Sallow and heavy-eyed, her head
aching, oppressed by a sense of the unbearable
unpleasantness of the situation, she threw on her
wrapper, and going to the window drew the curtain
and looked out.</p>

<p>The bedroom had but one window, wedged into
an angle of wall, and affording a glimpse of the
green lawn and clipped rose trees of the house next
door. There was a fog this morning and even this
curtailed prospect was obliterated. She stood
yawning drearily, and gazing out with eyes to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
which her yawns had brought tears. Her hair
made a wild bush round her head, her face looked
pinched and old. She was one of those women
whose good looks are dependent on animation and
millinery. In this fixity of inward thought, unobserved
in unbecoming disarray, one could realize
that she had attained the thirty-four years she
could so successfully deny under the rejuvenating
influences of full dress and high spirits.</p>

<p>During her toilet her thoughts refused to leave
the subject of last night&#8217;s quarrel. She and her
husband had had disagreements before&mdash;many in
the last year when they had virtually separated,
though the world did not know it&mdash;but nothing
so ignominiously repulsive as the scene of last
evening had yet degraded their companionship.
Bernice was ashamed. In the gray light of the
dim, disillusioning morning she realized that she
had gone too far. She knew Dominick to be
long-suffering, she knew that the hold she had
upon him was a powerful one, but the most patient
creatures sometimes rebel, the most compelling
sense of honor would sometimes break under too
severe a strain. As she trailed down the long
passage to the dining-room she made up her mind
that she would make the first overture toward
reconciliation that evening. It would be difficult
but she would do it.</p>

<p>She was speculating as to how she would begin,
in what manner she would greet him when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
came home, when her eyes fell on the folded note
against the clock. Apprehension clutched her as
she opened it. The few lines within frightened
her still more. He had gone&mdash;where? She turned
the note over, looking at the back, in a sudden
tremble of fearfulness. He had never done anything
like this before, left her, suddenly cut
loose from her in proud disgust. She stood
by the clock, staring at the paper, her face
fallen into scared blankness, the artificial hopefulness
that she had been fostering since she
awoke giving place to a down-drop into an abyss
of alarm.</p>

<p>The door into the kitchen creaked and the
Chinaman entered with the second part of the
dainty breakfast cooked especially for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What time did Mr. Ryan leave this morning?&#8221;
she said without turning, throwing the question
over her shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno,&#8221; the man returned, with the expressionless
brevity of his race particularly
accentuated in this case, as he did not like his
mistress. &#8220;He no take blickfuss here. He no
stay here last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>She faced round on him, her eyes full of a sudden
fierce intentness which marked them in moments
of angry surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t here last night?&#8221; she demanded.
&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>He arranged the dishes with careful precision,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
not troubling himself to look up, and speaking
with the same dry indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;He not here for blickfuss. No one sleep in his
bed. I go make bed&mdash;all made. I think he not
here all night.&#8221;</p>

<p>His work being accomplished he turned without
more words and passed into the kitchen. Berny
stood for a moment thinking, then, with a shrug
of defiance, left her buckwheat cakes untasted
and walked into the hall. She went directly to her
husband&#8217;s room and looked about with sharp
glances. She opened drawers and peered into
the wardrobes. She was a woman who had a
curiously keen memory for small domestic details,
and a few moments&#8217; investigation proved to her
that he had taken some of his oldest clothes, but
had left behind all the better ones, and that the
silver box of jewelry on the bureau&mdash;filled with
relics of the days when he had been the idolized
son of his parents&mdash;lacked none of its contents.</p>

<p>More alarmed than she had been in the course
of her married life she left the room and passed up
the hall to the parlor. The brilliant, over-furnished
apartment in which she had crowded every
fashion in interior decoration that had pleased
her fancy and been within the compass of her
purse, looked slovenly and unattractive in the
gray light of the morning. The smell of smoke was
strong in it and the butts and ashes of cigars
Dominick had been smoking the evening before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
lay in a tray on the center-table. She noticed
none of these things, which under ordinary circumstances
would have been ground for scolding,
for she was a woman of fastidious personal
daintiness. A cushioned seat was built round the
curve of the bay-window, and on this she sat down,
drawing back the fall of thick &eacute;cru lace that
veiled the pane. Her eyes were fastened with
an unwinking fixity on the fog-drenched street
without; her figure was motionless.</p>

<p>Her outward rigidity of body concealed an
intense inward energy of thought. It suddenly
appeared to her as if her hold on Dominick, which
till yesterday had seemed so strong that nothing
but death could break it, was weak, was nothing.
It had been rooted in his sense of honor, the sense
that she fostered in him and by means of which
she had been able to make him marry her. Was
this sense not so powerful as she believed, or&mdash;dreadful
thought!&mdash;was it weakening under the
friction of their life together? Had she played
on it too much and worn it out? She had been so
sure of Dominick, so secure in his blind, plodding
devotion to his duty! She had secretly wondered
at it, as a queer characteristic that it was
fortunate he possessed. Deep in her heart she
had a slight, amused contempt for it, a contempt
that had extended to other things. She
had felt it for him in those early days of their
marriage when he had looked forward to children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
and wanted to live quietly, without society,
in his own home. It grew stronger later when
she realized he had accepted his exclusion from
his world and was too proud to ask his mother
for money.</p>

<p>And now! Suppose he had gone back to his
people? A low ejaculation escaped her, and she
dropped the curtain and pressed her hand, clenched
to the hardness of a stone, against her breast.</p>

<p>The mere thought of such a thing was intolerable.
She did not see how she could support the
idea of his mother and sister winning him from
her. She hated them. They were the ones who
had wronged her, who had excluded her from the
home and the riches and the position that her
marriage should have given her. Her retaliation
had been her unwavering grip on Dominick and
the careful discretion with which she had comported
herself as his wife. There was no ground
of complaint against her. She had been as quiet,
home-keeping and dutiful a woman as any in
California. She had been a good housekeeper, a
skilful manager of her husband&#8217;s small means.
It was only within the last year that she had, in
angry spite, run into the debts with which she had
taunted him. No wife could have lived more
rigorously up to the letter of her marriage contract.
It was easy for her to do it. She was not
a woman whom light living and license attracted.
She had sacrificed her honor to win Dominick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
grudgingly, unwillingly, as close-fisted men part
with money in the hope of rich returns. She did
not want to be his mistress, but she knew of no
other means by which she could reach the position
of his wife.</p>

<p>Now suppose he had gone back to his people!
It was an insupportable, a maddening thought.
It plunged her into agitation that made her rise
and move about the room with an aimless restlessness,
like some soft-footed feline animal. Suppose
he had gone home and told them about last night,
and they had prevailed upon him not to come
back!</p>

<p>Well, even if they had, hers was still the
strong position. The sympathy of the disinterested
outsider would always be with her. If she
had been quarrelsome and ugly, those were small
matters. In the great essentials she had not
failed. Suppose she and the Ryans ever did come
to an open crossing of swords, would not her story
be <i>the</i> story of the two? The world&#8217;s sympathy
would certainly not go to the rich women, trampling
on the poor little typewriter, the honest
working-girl, who for one slip, righted by subsequent
marriage, had been the object of their
implacable antagonism and persecution.</p>

<p>She said this opposite the mirror, extending her
hands as she had seen an actress do in a recent
play. As she saw her pointed, pale face, her
expression of worry gave way to one of pleased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
complacence. She looked pathetic, and her position
was pathetic. Who would have the heart to
condemn her when they saw her and heard her
side of the story? Her spirits began to rise.
With the first gleam of returning confidence she
shook off her apprehensions. A struggle of sunshine
pierced the fog, and going to the window she
drew the curtains and looked out on the veil of
mist every moment growing brighter and thinner.
The sun finally pierced it, a patch of blue shone
above, and dropping the curtains she turned and
looked at the clock. It was after eleven. She
decided she would go out and take lunch with
her sisters, who were always ready to listen and
to sympathize with her.</p>

<p>These sisters were the only intimate friends and
companions Bernice had, their home the one house
to which she was a constant visitor. With all her
peculiarities and faults she possessed a strong
sense of kin. In her rise to fairer fortune, if not
greater happiness, her old home had never lost its
hold upon her, nor had she weakened in a sort of
cross-grained, patronizing loyalty to her two
sisters. This may have been accounted for by the
fact that they were exceedingly amiable and
affectionate, proud to regard Bernice as the
flower of the family, whose dizzy translation to
unexpected heights they had watched with unenvious
admiration.</p>

<p>Hannah, the oldest of the family, was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
daughter of a first marriage. She was now a
spinster of forty-five, and had taught school
for twenty years. Hazel was the youngest of the
three, she and Bernice having been the offspring
of Danny Iverson&#8217;s second alliance with a woman
of romantic tendencies, which had no way of
expressing themselves except in the naming of
her children. Hazel, while yet in her teens, had
married a clerk in a jewelry store, called
Josh McCrae. It had been a happy marriage.
After the birth of a daughter, Hazel had returned
to her work as saleslady in a fashionable millinery.
Both sisters, Josh, and the child, had
continued to live together in domestic harmony,
in the house which Hannah, with the savings of
a quarter of a century, had finally cleared of all
mortgages and now owned. No household could
have been more simply decent and honest; no
family more unaspiringly content. In such an
environment Bernice, with her daring ambitions
and bold unscrupulousness, was like that unaccounted-for
blossom which in the floral world is
known as a &#8220;sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it did not appear that she regarded herself
as such. With the exception of a year spent
in Los Angeles and Chicago she had been a member
of the household from her childhood till the
day of her marriage. The year of absence had
been the result of a sudden revolt against the
monotony of her life and surroundings, an upwelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
of the restless ambitions that preyed upon
her. A good position had been offered her in
Los Angeles and she had accepted it with eagerness,
thankful for the opportunity to see the
world, and break away, so she said, from the
tameness of her situation, the narrowness of her
circle. The spirit of adventure carried her farther
afield, and she penetrated as far across the continent
as Chicago, where she was employed in one
of the most prosperous business houses, earning
a large salary. But, like many Californians,
homesickness seized her, and before the year was
out she was back, inveighing against the eastern
manners, character, and climate, and glad to
shake down again into the family nest. Her
sisters were satisfied with her account of her
wanderings, not knowing that Bernice was as
much of an adept at telling half a story as she
was at taking down a dictation in typewriting.
She was too clever to be found out in a lie; they
were altogether too simple to suspect her apparent
frankness.</p>

<p>After the excursion she remained at home
until her marriage. Her liaison with Dominick
was conducted with the utmost secrecy. Her
sisters had not a suspicion of it, knew nothing
but that the young man was attentive to her,
till she told them of her approaching marriage.
This took place in the parlor of Hannah&#8217;s house,
and the amazed sisters, bewildered by Berny&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
glories, had waited to see her burst into the
inner circles of fashion and wealth with a tiara
of diamonds on her head and ropes of pearls
about her throat. That no tiara was forthcoming,
no pearls graced her bridal parure, and
no Ryan ever crossed the threshold of her door,
seemed to the loyal Hannah and Hazel the most
unmerited and inexplicable injustice that had
ever come within their experience.</p>

<p>It took Bernice some time to dress, for she
attached the greatest importance to all matters
of personal adornment, and the lunch hour was
at hand when she alighted from the Hyde Street
car and walked toward the house. It was on one
of those streets which cross Hyde near the slope
of Russian Hill, and are devoted to the habitats
of small, thrifty householders. A staring, bright
cleanliness is the prevailing characteristic of
the neighborhood, the cement sidewalks always
swept, the houses standing back in tiny squares
of garden, clipped and trimmed to a precise
shortness of grass and straightness of border.
The sun was now broadly out and the house-fronts
engarlanded with vines, their cream-colored faces
spotless in fresh coats of paint, presented a line
of uniform bay-windows to its ingratiating warmth.
Hannah&#8217;s was the third, and its gleaming clearness
of window-pane and the stainless purity of
its front steps were points of domestic decency
that its proprietor insisted on as she did on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
servant girl&#8217;s apron being clean and the parlor
free from dust.</p>

<p>Berny had retained her latch-key, and letting
herself in passed into the dustless parlor which
connected by folding doors with the dining-room
beyond. Nothing had been changed in it since
the days of her tenancy. The upright piano,
draped with a China silk scarf, stood in the old
corner. The solar print of her father hung over the
mantelpiece on which a gilt clock and a pair of
China dogs stood at accurately-measured distances.
The tufted arm-chairs were placed far
from each other, severely isolated in the corners,
as though the room were too remote and sacred
even to suggest the cheerful amenities of social
intercourse. A curious, musty smell hung in the
air. It recalled the past in which Dominick had
figured as her admirer. The few times that he
had been to her home she had received him in
this solemn, unaired apartment in which the
chandelier was lit for the occasion, and Hannah
and Hazel had sat in the kitchen, breathless with
curiosity as to what such a call might portend.
She had been married here, in the bay-window,
under a wedding bell of white roses. The musty
smell brought it all back, even her sense of almost
breathless elation, when the seal was set on her
daring schemes.</p>

<p>From beyond the folding doors a sound of
conversation and smitten crockery arose, also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
a strong odor of cooking. The family were
already at lunch, and opening the door Berny
entered in upon the midday meal which was
being partaken of by her two sisters, Josh,
and Hazel&#8217;s daughter Pearl, a pretty child of
eight.</p>

<p>Neither of her sisters resembled her in the
least. Hannah was a woman who looked more
than her age, with a large, calm face, and gentle,
near-sighted eyes which blinked at the world
behind a pair of steel-rimmed glasses. Her
quarter-century of school teaching had not
dried or stiffened her. She was fuller of the
milk of human kindness, of the ideals and
enthusiasms of youth, than either of her sisters.
All the love of her kindly, maternal nature was
given to Pearl, whom she was bringing up carefully
to be what seemed to Hannah best in
woman.</p>

<p>Hazel was very pretty and still young. She
had the fresh, even bloom of a Californian woman,
a round, graceful figure, and glossy brown hair,
rippled and arranged in an elaborate coiffure as
though done by a hair-dresser. She could do
this herself as she could make her own clothes,
earn a fair salary at the milliner&#8217;s, and sing to
the guitar in a small piping voice. Her husband
was ravished by her good looks and accomplishments,
and thought her the most wonderful woman
in the world. He was a thin, tall, young man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
with stooping shoulders, a long, lean neck, and
an amiable, insignificant face. But he seemed
to please Hazel, who had married him when she
was nineteen, being haunted by the nightmare
thought that if she did not take what chances
offered, she might become an old maid like Hannah.</p>

<p>Berny sat down next to the child, conscious
that under the pleasant friendliness of their
greetings a violent curiosity as to whether she
had been to the ball burned in each breast. She
had talked over her chances of going with them,
and Hazel, whose taste in all such matters was
excellent, had helped her order the dress. Now,
drawing her plate toward her and shaking out
her napkin, she began to eat her lunch, at once too
sore and too perverse to begin the subject. The
others endured their condition of ignorance for
some minutes, and then Hazel, finding that to
wait was useless, approached the vital topic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Berny, we&#8217;ve been looking over the
list of guests at the ball in the morning papers
and your name don&#8217;t seem to be down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why it should,&#8221; said Berny without
looking up, &#8220;considering I wasn&#8217;t there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You weren&#8217;t there!&#8221; ejaculated Hannah.
&#8220;They didn&#8217;t ask you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Berny, breaking a piece
of bread. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t ask me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be jiggered!&#8221; exclaimed Josh.
&#8220;That beats the Dutch!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t believe Mrs. Ryan would do that,&#8221;
said Hannah, so pained that her generally observant
eye took no note of the fact that Pearl was
putting her fingers in her plate. &#8220;You&#8217;re as good
as her own flesh and blood, too,&mdash;her son&#8217;s wife.
It&#8217;s not Christian, and I don&#8217;t understand it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s tough,&#8221; said Josh, &#8220;that&#8217;s what it is,
tough!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were you,&#8221; said Hazel with spirit, &#8220;husband
or no husband, I&#8217;d never want to go inside
that house or have any dealings with that crowd
again. If they were down on their knees to me
I&#8217;d never go near them. Just think what it would
be if Josh&#8217;s mother thought herself too good to
know me! I&#8217;d like to know what I&#8217;d feel about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she wouldn&#8217;t, dearie,&#8221; said Josh placatingly.
&#8220;She&#8217;d be proud to have you related to
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess she&#8217;d better be,&#8221; said Hazel, fixing
an indignant glare on her spouse. &#8220;She&#8217;d find
she&#8217;d barked up the wrong tree if she wasn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Considering that Josh&#8217;s mother had been dead
for twelve years and in her lifetime had been a
meek and unassuming woman who let lodgings,
Hazel&#8217;s proud repudiation at her possible scorn
seemed a profitless wasting of fires, and Josh
forthwith turned the conversation back to the
ball.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps they did send you an invitation,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
he said to Berny, &#8220;and it got lost in the mails.
That does happen, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny&#8217;s cheeks, under the faint bloom of rouge
that covered them, flamed a sudden, dusky red.
She had never been open with these simple relations
of hers and she was not going to begin now.
But she felt shame as she thought of Dominick&#8217;s
humiliating quest for the invitation that was
refused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; she said hurriedly. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t
sent, that&#8217;s all. Mrs. Ryan won&#8217;t have me
in the house. That&#8217;s the fact and there&#8217;s no
use trying to get round it. Well, she can do
without me. I seem able to support my existence
without her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her tone and manner, marked by a sort of
hard bravado, did not deceive her sisters, who
had that extreme na&iuml;vet&eacute; in expressing their
intimate feelings which is peculiar to Californians.
They looked at her with commiserating sympathy,
not quite comprehending her attitude of independence,
but feeling sorry for her, whatever pose
she adopted.</p>

<p>&#8220;And your dress,&#8221; said Hazel, &#8220;what will you
do with that? When will you ever wear it&mdash;a
regular ball-dress like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll wear it,&#8221; said Berny with an air of
having quantities of social opportunities not
known by her sisters. &#8220;It won&#8217;t be a loss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could put a guimpe in and have sleeves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
to the elbow and wear it to the theater. With a
white hat with plumes it would be a dead swell
costume. And if you met any of the Ryans
they&#8217;d see you were holding up your end of the
line and not <i>quite</i> ready yet to go to the alms-house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hannah shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how she could do that&mdash;transparent
neck and all. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the kind of
dress to wear in a theater. It&#8217;s too sort of
conspicuous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think Hannah&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Josh solemnly,
nodding at Berny. &#8220;It don&#8217;t seem to me the
right thing for a lady. Looks fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know about it, Josh McCrae?&#8221;
said Hazel pugnaciously. &#8220;You&#8217;re a clerk in a
jewelry store.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I am,&#8221; retorted Josh, &#8220;but I guess
that don&#8217;t prevent me from knowing when a thing
looks fast. Clerks in jewelry stores ain&#8217;t such
gummers as you might think. And, anyway, I
don&#8217;t see that being a clerk in any kind of a store
has anything to do with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazel was saved the effort of making a crushing
repartee, by Pearl, who had been silently eating
her lunch, now suddenly launching a remark into
the momentary pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Uncle Dominick go to the ball?&#8221; she
asked, raising a pair of limpid blue eyes to
Berny&#8217;s face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>An instantaneous, significant silence fell on the
others, and all eyes turned inquiringly to Berny.
Her air of cool control became slightly exaggerated.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he stayed at home with me,&#8221; she replied,
picking daintily at the meat on her plate.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I suppose he felt real hurt and annoyed,&#8221;
said Hannah. &#8220;He couldn&#8217;t have helped it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny did not reply. She knew that she must
sooner or later tell her sisters of Dominick&#8217;s
strange departure. They would find it out otherwise
and suspect more than she wanted them to
know. They, like the rest of the world, had no
idea that Berny&#8217;s brilliant marriage was not the
domestic success it appeared on the surface. She
moved her knife and fork with an arranging hand,
and, as Hazel started to speak, said with as careless
an air as she could assume,</p>

<p>&#8220;Dominick&#8217;s gone. He left this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>The news had even more of an effect than she
had expected. Her four companions stared at
her in wonderment. A return of the dread and
depression of the morning came upon her when she
saw their surprise. She felt her heart sink as it
had done when she read his note.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone where?&#8221; exclaimed Hazel. This was
the test question and Berny had schooled herself
in an answer in the car coming up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, up into the country,&#8221; she said nonchalantly.
&#8220;He&#8217;s worn out. They work the life out
of him in that horrible bank. He&#8217;s getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
insomnia and thought he&#8217;d better take a change
now before he got run completely down, so he left
this morning and I&#8217;m a gay grass widow.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed and drank some water. Her laugh
did not sound to her own ears convincing and she
was aware that, while Hannah was evidently satisfied
by her explanation, Hazel was eying her
ponderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if he&#8217;s got insomnia,&#8221; said Hannah,
&#8220;he&#8217;d better take his holiday right now. That&#8217;s
the best thing to do. Take it in the beginning.
Before father took ill&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Josh interrupted her, as Hannah&#8217;s reminiscences
of the late contractor&#8217;s last illness were
long and exhaustive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d you say he&#8217;d gone?&#8221; he queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t remember the name,&#8221; Berny answered
with skilfully-assumed indifference; &#8220;somewhere
down toward Santa Cruz and Monterey, some new
place. And he may not stay there. If he doesn&#8217;t
like it, he&#8217;ll just move around from place to place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you go, too?&#8221; said Pearl.</p>

<p>This was the second question Berny had
dreaded. Now suddenly she felt her throat contract
and her lips quiver. Her usually iron nerve
had been shaken by her passion of the night
before and the shock of the morning. The
unwonted sensations of gloom and apprehension
closed in on her again, and this time made her feel
weak and tearful.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to. I hate moving round,&#8221;
she said, pushing her chair back from the table.
Her voice was a little hoarse, and suddenly feeling
the sting of tears under her eyelids she raised her
hands to her hat and began to fumble with her
veil. &#8220;Why should I leave my comfortable flat
to go trailing round in a lot of half-built hotels?
That sort of thing doesn&#8217;t appeal to me at all.
I like my own cook, and my own bed, and my own
bath-tub. I&#8217;m more of an old maid than Hannah.
Well, so long, people. I must be traveling.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laid her napkin on the table and jumped up
with an assumption of brisk liveliness. She paid
no attention to the expostulations of her relatives,
but going to the glass arranged her hat and put on
her gloves. When she turned back to the table
she had regained possession of herself. Her veil
was down and through it her cheeks looked
unusually flushed, and her dark eyes, with their
slanting outer corners, brighter and harder than
ever. She hurried through her good-bys on the
plea that she had shopping to do, and almost ran
out of the house, leaving a trail of perfumery and
high, artificial laughter behind her.</p>

<p>For the next week she waited for news from
Dominick and none came. It was a trying seven
days. Added to her harassment of mind, the
loneliness of the flat was almost unendurable.
There was no one to speak to, no one to share her
anxieties. Her position was unusually friendless.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
When her marriage had lifted her from the ranks
of working women she had shown so cold a face to
her old companions that they had dropped away
from her, realizing that she wished to cut all ties
with the world of her humble beginnings. New
friends had been hard to make. The wives of
some of the bank officials, and odd, aspiring
applicants for such honors as would accrue from
even this remote connection with the august name
of Ryan, were all she had found wherewith to
make a circle and a visiting list.</p>

<p>But she was intimate with none of them and was
now too worried to seek the society of mere
acquaintances. She ate her solitary meals in oppressive
silence, feeling the Chinaman&#8217;s eyes fixed
upon her in ironic disbelief of the story she had told
him to account for Dominick&#8217;s absence. Eat as
slowly as she would, her dinner could not be made
to occupy more than twenty minutes, and after
that there was the long evening, the interminable
evening, to be passed. She was a great reader of
newspapers, and when she returned from her
afternoon shopping she brought a bundle of
evening papers home in her hand. She would
read these slowly, at first the important items,
then go over them for matters of less moment, and
finally scan the advertisements. But even with
this occupation the evenings were of a vast,
oppressive emptiness, and her worries crowded in
upon her, when, the papers lying round her feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
in a sea of billowing, half-folded sheets, she sat
motionless, the stillness of the empty flat and the
deserted street lying round her like an expression
of her own blank depression.</p>

<p>At the end of the week she felt that she must
find out something, and went to the bank. It was
her intention to cash a small check and over this
transaction see if the paying teller would vouchsafe
any information about Dominick. She pushed
the check through the opening and, as the man
counted out the money, said glibly,</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hear anything of my wandering husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>The teller pushed the little pile of silver and
gold through the window toward her and leaning
forward, said, with the air of one who intends to
have a leisurely moment of talk,</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we haven&#8217;t. Isn&#8217;t it our place to come
to you for that? We were wondering where he&#8217;d
gone at such a season.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny&#8217;s delicately-gloved fingers made sudden
haste to gather up the coins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s just loafing about,&#8221; she said as easily
as was consistent with the disappointment and
alarm that gripped her. &#8220;He&#8217;s just wandering
round from place to place. He was getting
insomnia and wanted a change of scene.&#8221;</p>

<p>She snapped the clasp of her purse before the
man could ask her further questions, nodded her
good-bys, and turned from the window. Her face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
changed as she emerged on the wide, stone steps
that led to the street. It was pinched and pale,
two lines drawn between the eyebrows. She
descended the steps slowly, the flood of magnificent
sunshine having no warming influence upon
the chill that had seized upon her. Many of the
passing throng of men looked at her&mdash;a pretty
woman in her modishly-made dress of tan-colored
cloth and her close-fitting brown turban with a
bunch of white paradise feathers at one side.
Under her dotted veil her carefully made-up
complexion looked naturally clear and rosy, and
her eyes, accentuated by a dark line beneath them,
were in attractive contrast to her reddened hair.
But she was not thinking of herself or the admiration
she evoked, a subject which was generally of
overpowering interest. Matters of more poignant
moment had crowded all else from her mind.</p>

<p>The next week began and advanced and still no
news from Dominick. He had been gone fourteen
days, when one evening in her perusal of the paper
she saw his name. Her trembling hands pressed
the sheet down on the table, and her eyes devoured
the printed lines. It was one of the many short
despatches that had come from the foot-hill mining
towns on the recent storms in the Sierra. It was
headed Rocky Bar and contained a description of
the situation at Antelope and the snow-bound
colony there. Its chief item of information was
that Bill Cannon and his daughter were among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
prisoners in Perley&#8217;s Hotel. A mention was made,
only a line or two, of Dominick&#8217;s walk from Rocky
Bar, but it was treated lightly and gave no idea of
the real seriousness of that almost fatal excursion.</p>

<p>Berny read the two short paragraphs many
times, and her spirits went up like the needle of
a thermometer when the quicksilver is grasped
in a warm hand. Her relief was intense, easeful
and relaxing, as the sudden cessation of a pain.
Not only was Dominick at last found, but he was
found in a place as far removed from his own
family and its influences as he was from her.
And best of all he was shut up, incarcerated, with
Bill Cannon, the Bonanza King. What might
not come of it? Berny was not glad of the quarrel,
but it seemed a wonderful piece of luck that
that unpleasant episode should have sent him into
the very arms of the man that she had always
wanted him to cultivate and who was the best
person in the world for him to impress favorably.
If Bill Cannon, who had been a friend of his
father&#8217;s, took a fancy to Dominick, there was no
knowing what might happen. In a sudden reaction
of relief and hope Berny saw them almost
adopted children of the Bonanza King, flouting
the Ryans in the pride of their new-found honors.</p>

<p>It made her feel lenient to Dominick, whose indifference
and neglect had put her to the torments
of the last fortnight. After all, he could not have
let her know his whereabouts. The wires were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
only just up, and the rural mail-carrier had not yet
been able to effect an entrance into the snow-bound
town. Why Dominick had chosen to go in this
direction and had attempted an impossible walk
in a heavy snowstorm Berny did not know, nor
just now care much. A sensation as near remorse
and tenderness as she could feel possessed her.
Under its softening influence&mdash;spurred to generosity
and magnanimity by the lifting of the weight
of anxiety&mdash;she decided that she would write to
him. She would write him a letter which would
smooth out the difficulties between them and
bring him home ready to forgive and be once
more his old self, kind, quiet, and indulgent, as
he had been in the first year of their marriage.</p>

<p>Then and there, without further waiting, she
wrote the letter. It ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Dear Husband</span>:&mdash;I have only just seen
in the paper where you are, and, oh, the relief!
For two weeks now I have been half crazy, wondering
about you, waiting to hear from you.
And nothing ever came. Dominick, dear, if you
had seen me sitting here alone in the den every
evening, thinking and waiting, looking at the
clock and listening all the time, even when I was
trying to read&mdash;listening for your footsteps which
never came&mdash;you would have felt very sorry for
me; even you, who were so angry that you left
me without a word. It&#8217;s just been hell this
last two weeks. You may not think by the
way I acted that I would have cared, but I did,
I do. If I didn&#8217;t love you would I mind how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
your people treated me? That&#8217;s what makes it
so hard, because I love you and want you to be
happy with me, and it&#8217;s dreadful for me to see
them always getting in between us, till sometimes
lately I have felt they were going to separate
us altogether.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear husband, don&#8217;t let that happen!
Don&#8217;t let them drive me away from you! If
I have been bad-humored and unreasonable,
I have had to bear a lot. I am sorry for the past.
I am sorry for what I said to you that night, and
for turning on the gas and scratching the bed.
I am ready to acknowledge that I was wrong,
and was mean and hateful. And now you ought
to be ready to forgive me and forget it all. Come
back to me. Please come back. Don&#8217;t be angry
with me. I am your wife. You chose me of
your own free will. That I loved you so that I
forgot honor and public opinion and had no will
but yours, you know better than any one else
in the world. It isn&#8217;t every man, Dominick, that
gets that kind of love. I gave it then and I&#8217;ve
never stopped giving it, though I&#8217;ve often been so
put upon and enraged that I&#8217;ve said things I
didn&#8217;t mean and done things I&#8217;ve been ready to
kill myself for. Here I am now, waiting for you,
longing for you. Come back to me.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Your loving wife,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Berny</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>She read the letter over several times and it
pleased her greatly. So anxious was she to have
it go as soon as possible that, though it was past
ten, she took it out herself and posted it in the
letter-box at the corner.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>SNOW-BOUND</small></h2>
</div>

<p>While the world went about its affairs, attended
to its business, read its papers, sent its telegrams
and wrote its letters, the little group at Antelope
was as completely cut off from it as though
marooned on a strip of sand in an unknown sea.
A second storm had followed the original one,
and the end of the first week saw them snowed
in deeper than ever, Antelope a trickle of roofs
and smoke-stacks, in a white, crystal-clear wilderness,
solemn in its stillness and loneliness as the
primeval world.</p>

<p>The wires were down; the letter-carrier could
not break his way in to them. They heard no
news and received no mail. Confined in a group
of rude buildings, crouched in a hollow of the
Sierra&#8217;s flank, they felt for the first time what it
was to be outside that circle of busy activity in
which their lives had heretofore passed. They
were face to face with the nature they thought
they had conquered and which now in its quiet
grandeur awed them with a sense of their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
small helplessness. Pressed upon by that enormous
silent indifference they drew nearer together,
each individual unit gaining in importance from
the contrasting immensity without, each character
unconsciously declaring itself, emerging from
acquired reticences and becoming bolder and
more open.</p>

<p>They accepted their captivity in a spirit of
gay good humor. The only two members of the
party to whom it seemed irksome were Bill
Cannon and the actor, both girding against a
confinement which kept them from their several
spheres of action. The others abandoned themselves
to a childish, almost fantastic enjoyment
of a situation unique in their experience. It was
soon to end, it would never be repeated. It was
an adventure charged with romance, accidental,
unsought, as all true adventures are. The world
was forgotten for these few days of imprisonment
against the mountain&#8217;s mighty heart. It did not
exist for them. All that was real was their own
little party, the whitewashed passages and walls
of Perley&#8217;s, the dining-room with its board floor
and homely fare, and the parlor at night with a
semicircle of faces round the blazing logs.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the sixth day Dominick
made his first appearance down stairs. He
achieved the descent with slow painfulness,
hobbling between Perley and the doctor. The
former&#8217;s bath-robe had been cast aside for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
dignified dark-brown dressing-gown, contributed
to his wardrobe by Cannon, and which, cut to fit
the burly proportions of the Bonanza King, hung
around the long, lank form of the young man in
enveloping folds.</p>

<p>The parlor was empty, save for Miss Cannon
sitting before the fire. Dominick had ceased to
feel bashfulness and constraint in the presence
of this girl, who had been pushed&mdash;against his
will if not against her own&mdash;into the position of
his head attendant. The afternoon when they
had sat together in his room seemed to have
brushed away all his shyness and self-consciousness.
He thought now that it would be difficult to
retain either in intercourse with a being who was
so candid, so spontaneous, so freshly natural.
He found himself treating her as if she were a
young boy with whom he had been placed on a
sudden footing of careless, cheery intimacy. But
her outward seeming&mdash;what she presented to the
eye&mdash;was not in the least boyish. Her pale,
opaque blondness, her fine, rich outlines, her
softness of mien, were things as completely and
graciously feminine as the most epicurean admirer
of women could have wished.</p>

<p>Now, at the sight of her bending over the fire,
he experienced a sensation of pleasure which
vaguely surprised him. He was hardly conscious
that all the time he had been dressing and while
he came down stairs he had been hoping that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
would be there. He sent a quick glance ahead
of him, saw her, and looked away. The pain of
his feet was violent, and without again regarding
her he knew that while he was gaining his chair
and his attendants were settling him, she had not
turned from her contemplation of the fire. He
already knew her well enough to have a comfortable
assurance of her invariable quick tact.
It was not till the two men were leaving the room
that she turned to him and said, as if resuming
an interrupted conversation,</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how do you like the parlor? Speak
nicely of it for I feel as if it belonged to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a first-rate parlor,&#8221; he answered, looking
about him. &#8220;Never saw a better one. Who&#8217;s
the gentleman with the wreath of wax flowers
round his head?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Jim Granger. He comes from here,
you know; and you mustn&#8217;t laugh at those flowers,
they came off his coffin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father knew him,&#8221; said the young man
indifferently. &#8220;There were lots of queer stories
about Jim Granger. He killed a man once up
at Bodie. You&#8217;ve a fine fire here, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine. It&#8217;s never allowed to go out. What
do you think I intend to do this afternoon? I&#8217;ve
a plan for amusing and instructing you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he said somewhat uneasily.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel in the least as if I wanted to be
instructed.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>She rose and moved to the center-table which
was covered with an irregular scattering of books.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before you came down I was looking over
these books. There are lots of them. Mrs.
Perley says they&#8217;ve been accumulating for years.
Mining men have left them and some of them
have the names of people I know written in them.
I thought perhaps you might like to read some
of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dominick sent a lazily disparaging glance over
the books. He was not much of a reader at the
best of times.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they,&#8221; he said, &#8220;novels?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mostly.&#8221; She sat down by the table and took
up the volume nearest to her. &#8220;Here&#8217;s <i>Tale of
Two Cities</i>. That&#8217;s a fine one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve read it. Yes, it&#8217;s splendid. It&#8217;s all
about the French Revolution. The hero&#8217;s like a
real person and heroes in books hardly ever are,
only I&#8217;d have liked him better if he&#8217;d stopped
drinking and married his girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought perhaps you might like me to read
to you,&#8221; she said, turning a tentative glance on
him. &#8220;That&#8217;s how I was going to amuse and
instruct you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it would be much more amusing
and probably just as instructive if you talked
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to stay down here two hours.
How could I talk and be amusing and instructive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
for two hours? You&#8217;d probably have a relapse
and I&#8217;m quite sure the doctor&#8217;d find me in a dead
faint on the hearth when he came in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Let&#8217;s try the books. Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s
risk relapses and dead faints.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then, that&#8217;s understood. We&#8217;ll go
through the library now. I&#8217;ll read the titles and
you say if you like any of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose I don&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll surely have a preference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll try to. Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s <i>Foul Play</i>, by Charles Reade. It
seems to have been a good deal read. Some of the
paragraphs are marked with a pencil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ve read it, but I&#8217;m not sure. It
sounds like a murder story. No, let&#8217;s pass on
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here&#8217;s <i>Mrs. Skaggs&#8217; Husbands</i>, by Bret
Harte. Does that sound as if you&#8217;d like it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Husbands!&#8217; No. We don&#8217;t want to read
about a woman who has husbands. Pass on
that, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The next is very nicely bound and looks quite
fresh and new, as if nobody had read it much.
It&#8217;s called <i>The Amazing Marriage</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pass on that! I had it once and stuck in
the third chapter. The last time I went East
somebody gave it to me to read on the train. I
read three chapters and I was more amazed than
anybody in sight. The porter was a fresh coon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
and I gave it to him as my revenge. I&#8217;ll bet it
amazed him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to have anything in the
nature of a preference, so far. I wonder how this
will suit you. <i>Notre Dame de Paris</i>, by Victor
Hugo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand French.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s in English and it&#8217;s quite worn out, as if it
had been read over and over. Several of the
pages are falling out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve read that. I just remember. It&#8217;s
a rattling good story, too. About the hunchback
and the gipsy girl who tells fortunes and has a pet
goat. The priest, who&#8217;s a villain, falls off the
steeple and clings to a gutter by his finger nails
with his enemy watching him. It&#8217;s the finest kind
of a story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a pity that you&#8217;ve read it! Oh, here&#8217;s
one that&#8217;s evidently been a great favorite. It&#8217;s
in paper and it&#8217;s all thumbed and torn. Somebody&#8217;s
written across the top, &#8216;Of all the
damned fool people&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;. Oh, I beg your pardon,
I read it before I realized. The name is
<i>Wife in Name Only</i>. It doesn&#8217;t seem the kind
of title that makes you want to read the book,
does it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wife in Name Only!&#8217;&#8221; he gave a short
laugh. &#8220;It certainly isn&#8217;t the kind of name that
would make <i>me</i> want to read a book.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor me,&#8221; said a deep voice behind them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>They both turned to see Buford, the actor,
standing back of the table, his tall, angular figure
silhouetted against the pale oblong of the uncurtained
window. He was smiling suavely, but at
the same time with a sort of uneasy, assumed
assurance, which suggested that he was not
unused to rebuffs.</p>

<p>&#8220;That, certainly,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is not a name to
recommend a book to any man&mdash;any man, that
is, who has or ever had a wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>He advanced into the circle of the firelight,
blandly beaming at the young man, who, leaning
back in his chair, was eying him with surprised
inquiry, never having seen him before. The look
did not chill the friendly effusion of the actor who,
approaching Dominick, said with the full, deep
resonance of his remarkable voice,</p>

<p>&#8220;Congratulations, my dear sir, congratulations.
Not alone on your recovery, but on the fact that
you are here with us at all.&#8221; He held out his
large hand, the skin chapped and red with the
cold, and the long fingers closed with a wrenching
grip on Dominick&#8217;s. &#8220;We were not sure, when
you arrived among us a few nights ago, that we
would have the felicity of seeing you so soon up
and around&mdash;in fact, we were doubtful whether
we would <i>ever</i> see you up and around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, very kind of you. Oh, I&#8217;m all right
now.&#8221; Dominick pressed the hand in return and
then, bending a little forward, sent a glance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
imploring query round the stranger&#8217;s shoulder at
Rose.</p>

<p>She caught the eye, read its behest, and presented
the new-comer:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Ryan, this is Mr. Buford who is snowed
in here with us. Mr. Buford came here the same
day as you, only he came on the Murphysville
stage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buford sat down between them on one of the
horsehair chairs that were sociably arranged
round the table. The firelight threw into prominence
the bony angles of his thin face and glazed
the backward sweep of his hair, dark-brown, and
worn combed away from his forehead, where a
pair of heavy, flexible eyebrows moved up and
down like an animated commentary on the conversation.
When anything surprising was said they
went up, anything puzzling or painful they were
drawn down. He rested one hand on his knee,
the fingers turned in, and, sitting bolt upright,
buttoned tight into his worn frock-coat, turned a
glance of somewhat deprecating amiability upon
the invalid.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had a pretty close call, <i>a-pretty-close-call</i>,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;If the operator at Rocky Bar
hadn&#8217;t had the sense to wire up here, that would
have been the end of <i>your</i> life story.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dominick had heard this from every member of
the snowed-in party. Repetition was not making
it any more agreeable, and there was an effect of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
abrupt ungraciousness in his short answer which
was merely a word of comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t the people at the Rocky Bar Hotel try
to dissuade you from starting?&#8221; said Buford.
&#8220;They must have known it was dangerous.
They must have been worried about you or they
wouldn&#8217;t have telegraphed up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I believe they did.&#8221; The young man
tried to hide the annoyance the questions gave
him under a dry brevity of speech. &#8220;They did
all that they ought to have done. I&#8217;ll see them
again on my way down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet you persisted!&#8221; The actor turned to
Rose with whom, as he sat beside her at table, he
had become quite friendly. &#8220;The blind confidence
of youth, Miss Cannon, isn&#8217;t it a grand,
inspiring thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dominick shifted his aching feet under the rug.
He was becoming exceedingly irritated and
impatient, and wondered how much longer he
would be able to respond politely to the conversational
assiduities of the stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; continued Buford, &#8220;kindly satisfy my
curiosity on one point. Why, when you were
told of the danger of the enterprise, did you
start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I liked the danger, wanted it to tone
me up. I&#8217;m a bank clerk, Mr. Buford, and my
life&#8217;s monotonous. Danger&#8217;s a change.&#8221;</p>

<p>He raised his voice and spoke with sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
rude defiance. Buford looked quickly at him,
while his eyebrows went up nearly to his hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bank clerk, oh!&#8221; he said with a falling
inflection of disappointment, much chagrined to
discover that the child of millions occupied such
a humble niche. &#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;was not aware of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An assistant cashier,&#8221; continued Dominick in
the same key of exasperation, &#8220;and I managed to
get a holiday at this season because my father was
one of the founders of the bank and they allow
me certain privileges. If you would like to know
anything else ask me and I&#8217;ll answer as well as I
know how.&#8221;</p>

<p>His manner and tone so plainly indicated his
resentment of the other&#8217;s curiosity that the actor
flushed and shrank. He was evidently well-meaning
and sensitive, and the young man&#8217;s
rudeness hurt rather than angered him. For a
moment nothing was said, Buford making no
response other than to clear his throat, while he
stretched out one arm and pulled down his cuff
with a jerking movement. There was constraint
in the air, and Rose, feeling that he had been
treated with unnecessary harshness, sought to
palliate it by lifting the book on her lap and saying
to him,</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the book we were talking about when
you came in, Mr. Buford, <i>Wife in Name Only</i>.
Have you read it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She handed him the ragged volume, and holding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
it off he eyed it with a scrutiny all the more
marked by the way he drew his heavy brows down
till they hung like bushy eaves over his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my dear young lady. I have not. Nor
do I feel disposed to do so. &#8216;Wife in Name Only!&#8217;
That tells a whole story without reading a word.
Were <i>you</i> going to read it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; Mr. Ryan and I were just looking over
them. We were thinking about reading one of
them aloud. This one happened to be on the pile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To me,&#8221; continued Buford, &#8220;the name is
repelling because it suggests sorrows of my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause. He evidently expected a
question which undoubtedly was not going to
come from Dominick, who sat fallen together in the
arm-chair looking at him with moody ill-humor.
There was more hope from Rose, who gazed at the
floor but said nothing. Buford was forced to
repeat with an unctuous depth of tone, &#8220;Suggests
sorrows of my own,&#8221; and fasten his glance on her,
so that, as she raised her eyes, they encountered
the commanding encouragement of his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorrows of your own?&#8221; she repeated timidly,
but with the expected questioning inflection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear Miss Cannon,&#8221; returned the
actor with a melancholy which was full of a rich,
dark enjoyment. &#8220;<i>My</i> wife is one in name only.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was another pause, and neither of the
listeners showing any intention of breaking it,
Buford remarked,</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>&#8220;<i>That</i> sorrow is mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>What</i> sorrow?&#8221; said Dominick bruskly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sorrow of a deserted man,&#8221; returned the
actor with now, for the first time, something of
the dignity of real feeling in his manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; the monosyllable was extremely non-committal,
but it had an air of finality as though
Dominick intended to say no more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has she&mdash;er&mdash;left you?&#8221; said the girl in a low
and rather awe-stricken voice.</p>

<p>The actor inclined his head in an acquiescent
bow:</p>

<p>&#8220;She has.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again there was a pause. Unless Buford chose
to be more biographical, the conversation appeared
to have come to a deadlock. Neither of the
listeners could at this stage break into his reserve
with questions and yet to switch off on a new
subject was not to be thought of at a moment of
such emotional intensity. The actor evidently
felt this, for he said suddenly, with a relapse into
a lighter tone and letting his eyebrows escape
from an overshadowing closeness to his eyes,</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should I trouble you with the sorrows
that have cast their shadow on me? Why
should my matrimonial troubles be allowed to
darken the brightness of two young lives which
have not yet known the joys and the perils of the
wedded state?&#8221;</p>

<p>The pause that followed this remark was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
most portentous that had yet fallen on the trio.
Rose cast a surreptitious glance at the dark
figure of young Ryan, lying back in the shadows
of the arm-chair. As she looked he stirred and
said with the abrupt, hard dryness which had
marked his manner since Buford&#8217;s entrance,</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take too much for granted, Mr. Buford.
I&#8217;ve known some of the joys and perils of the
wedded state myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The actor stared at him in open-eyed surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I rightly understand,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you
are a married man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do,&#8221; returned Dominick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really now, I never would have guessed it!
Pardon me for not having given you the full dues
of your position. Your wife, I take it, has no
knowledge of the risk she recently ran of losing
her husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he replied with a manner of sudden
cheery playfulness, &#8220;we&#8217;ll take good care that
she doesn&#8217;t learn. When the wires are up we&#8217;ll
concoct a telegram that shall be a masterpiece of
diplomatic lying. Lucky young man to have a
loving wife at home. Of all of us <i>you</i> are the one
who can best realize the meaning of the line,
&#8216;&#8217;Tis sweet to know there is an eye to mark our
coming and&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Dominick threw the rug off and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can get Perley to help me I&#8217;ll go up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
stairs again. I&#8217;m tired and I&#8217;ll go back to my
room.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried to step forward, but the pain of his
unhealed foot was unbearable, and he caught the
edge of the table and held it, his face paling
with sudden anguish. The actor, startled by the
abruptness of his uprising, approached him with
a vague proffer of assistance and was arrested by
his sharp command:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and get Perley! He&#8217;s in the bar probably.
I can&#8217;t stand this way for long. Hurry up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Buford ran out of the room, and Rose somewhat
timidly drew near the young man, braced against
the table, his eyes down-bent, his face hard in
the struggle with sudden and unfamiliar pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I help you?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Perley may
not be there. Mr. Buford and I can get you up
stairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; he answered, his words short but his
tone more conciliatory. &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing to bother
about. I&#8217;d have wrung that man&#8217;s neck if I&#8217;d
had to listen to him five minutes longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Perley and Buford entered, and the former,
offering his support to the invalid, led him
hobbling out of the door and into the hall. The
actor looked after them for a moment and then
came back to the fire where Miss Cannon was
standing, thoughtfully regarding the burning logs.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that young Mr.
Ryan is an estimable gentleman, but he certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
appears to be possessed by a very impatient and
ugly temper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buford had found Miss Cannon one of the most
amiable and charming ladies he had ever met,
and it was therefore a good deal of a surprise to
have her turn upon him a face of cold, reproving
disagreement, and remark in a voice that matched
it:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t agree with you at all, Mr. Buford, and
you seem quite to forget that Mr. Ryan has been
very sick and is still in great pain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buford was exceedingly abashed. He would
not have offended Miss Cannon for anything in
the world, and it seemed to him that a being so
compact of graciousness and consideration would
be the first to censure an exhibition of ill-humor
such as young Ryan had just made. He stammered
an apologetic sentence and it did not add
to his comfort to see that she was not entirely
mollified by it and to feel that she exhaled a slight,
disapproving coldness that put him at a great
distance and made him feel mortified and ill at
ease.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>THE UNKNOWN EROS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The ten days that followed were among the
most important of Dominick Ryan&#8217;s life. Looking
back at them he wondered that he had been
so blind to the transformation of his being which
was taking place. Great emotional crises are
often not any more recognized, by the individuals,
than great transitional epochs are known by the
nations experiencing them. Dominick did not
realize that the most engrossing, compelling
passion he had ever felt was slowly invading him.
He did not argue that he was falling in love
with a woman he could never own and of whom
it was a sin to think. He did not argue or think
about anything. He was as a vessel gradually
filling with elemental forces, and like the vessel
he was passive till some jar would shake it and
the forces would run over. Meantime he was
held by a determination, mutinous and unreasoning
as the determination of a child, to live in the
present. He had the feeling of the desert traveler
who has found the oasis. The desert lay behind
him, burning and sinister with the agony of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
transit, and the desert lay before him with its
horrors to be faced, but for the moment he could
lie still and rest and forget by the fountain under
the cool of the trees.</p>

<p>He did not consciously think of Rose. But if
she were not there he was uneasy till she came
again. His secret exhilaration at her approach,
the dead blankness of his lack of her when she
was absent, told him nothing. These were the
feelings he had, and they filled him and left no
cool residue of reason wherewith to watch and
guard. He was taken unawares, so drearily confident
of his allegiance to his particular private
tragedy that he did not admit the possibility of
a defection. A sense of rest was on him and he
set it down&mdash;if he ever thought of it at all&mdash;to
the relief of a temporary respite. Poor Dominick,
with his inexperience of sweet things, did not
argue that respite from pain should be a quiescent,
contented condition of being, far removed from
that state of secret, troubled gladness that thrilled
him at the sound of a woman&#8217;s footstep.</p>

<p>No situation could have been invented better
suited for the fostering of sentiment. His helpless
state demanded her constant attention. The
attitude of nurse to patient, the solicitude of the
consoling woman for the disabled, suffering man,
have been, since time immemorial, recognized
aids to romance. Rose, if an unawakened woman,
was enough of one to enjoy richly this maternal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
office of alternate cossetting and ruling one, who,
in the natural order of things, should have stood
alone in his strength, dictating the law. Perhaps
the human female so delights in this particular
opportunity for tyranny because it is one of her
few chances for indulging her passion for authority.</p>

<p>Rose, if she did not quite revel in it, discreetly
enjoyed her period of dominance. In the beginning
Dominick had been not a man but a patient&mdash;about
the same to her as the doll is to the little
girl. Then when he began to get better, and the
man rose, tingling with renewed life, from the
ashes of the patient, she quickly fell back into
the old position. With the inherited, dainty
deceptiveness of generations of women, who, while
they were virtuous, were also charming, she
relinquished her dominion and retreated into that
enfolded maidenly reserve and docility which we
feel quite sure was the manner adopted by the
ladies of the Stone Age when they felt it necessary
to manage their lords.</p>

<p>She was as unconscious of all this as Dominick
was of his growing absorption in her. If he was
troubled she was not. The days saw her growing
gayer, more blithe and light-hearted. She sang
about the corridors, her smile grew more radiant,
and every man in the hotel felt the power of her
awakening womanhood. Her boyish frankness of
demeanor was still undimmed by the first blurring
breath of passion. If Dominick was not in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
parlor her disappointment was as candid as a
child&#8217;s whose mother has forgotten to bring home
candy. All that she showed of consciousness was
that when he was there and there was no disappointment,
she concealed her satisfaction, wrapped
herself in a sudden, shy quietness, as completely
extinguishing of all beneath as a nun&#8217;s habit.</p>

<p>The continued, enforced intimacy into which
their restricted quarters and indoor life threw
them could not have been more effectual in fanning
the growing flame if designed by a malicious
Fate. There was only one sitting-room, and,
unable to go out, they sat side by side in it all
day. They read together, they talked, they
played cards. They were seldom alone, but the
presence of Bill Cannon, groaning over the fire
with a three-weeks-old newspaper for company,
was not one that diverted their attention from
each other; and Cora and Willoughby, as opponents
in a game of euchre, only helped to accentuate
the comradeship which leagued them
together in defensive alliance.</p>

<p>The days that were so long to others were to
them of a bright, surprising shortness. Playing
solitaire against each other on either side of the
fireplace was a pastime at which hours slipped
by. Quite unexpectedly it would be midday, with
Cora putting her head round the door-post and
calling them to dinner. In the euchre games of
the afternoon the darkness crept upon them with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
the stealthy swiftness of an enemy. It would
gather in the corners of the room while Cora was
still heated and flushed from her efforts to instruct
Willoughby in the intricacies of the game, and
yet preserve that respectful attitude which she
felt should be assumed in one&#8217;s relations with a
lord.</p>

<p>The twilight hour that followed was to Dominick&#8217;s
mind the most delightful of these days of
fleeting enchantment. The curtains were drawn,
a new log rolled on the fire, and the lamp lit.
Then their fellow prisoners began dropping in&mdash;the
old judge stowing himself away in one of the
horsehair arm-chairs, Willoughby and Buford
lounging in from the bar, Mrs. Perley with a
basket of the family mending, and the doctor all
snowy from his rounds. The audience for Rose&#8217;s
readings had expanded from the original listener
to this choice circle of Antelope&#8217;s elect. The book
chosen had been <i>Great Expectations</i>, and the
spell of that greatest tale of a great romancer
fell on the snow-bound group and held them
entranced and motionless round the friendly
hearth.</p>

<p>The young man&#8217;s eyes passed from face to face,
avoiding only that of the reader bent over the
lamp-illumined page. The old judge, sunk comfortably
into the depths of his arm-chair, listened,
and cracked the joints of his lean, dry fingers.
Willoughby, his dogs crouched about his feet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
looked into the fire, his attentive gravity broken
now and then by a slow smile. Mrs. Perley, after
hearing the chapter which describes Mrs. Gargery&#8217;s
methods of bringing up Pip &#8220;by hand,&#8221; attended
regularly with the remark that &#8220;it was a queer
sort of book, but some way or other she liked it.&#8221;
When Cora was forced to leave to attend to her
duties in the dining-room, she tore herself away
with murmurous reluctance. The doctor slipped
in at the third reading and asked Rose if she would
lend him the book in the morning &#8220;to read up
what he had missed.&#8221; Even Perley&#8217;s boy, in his
worn corduroys, his dirty, chapped hands rubbing
his cap against his nose, was wont to sidle noiselessly
in and slip into a seat near the door.</p>

<p>The climax of the day was the long evening
round the fire. There was no reading then. It
was the men&#8217;s hour, and the smoke of their pipes
and cigars lay thick in the air. Cut off from the
world in this cranny of the mountains, with the
hotel shaking to the buffets of the wind and the
snow blanket pressing on the pane, their memories
swept back to the wild days of their youth, to
the epic times of frontiersman and pioneer.</p>

<p>The judge told of his crossing of the plains in
forty-seven and the first Mormon settlement on the
barren shores of Salt Lake. He had had encounters
with the Indians, had heard the story of Olive Oatman
from one who had known her, and listened to
the sinister tale of the Donner party from a survivor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
Bill Cannon had &#8220;come by the Isthmus&#8221;
in forty-eight, a half-starved, ragged lad who had
run away from uncongenial drudgery on a New
York farm. His reminiscences went back to the
San Francisco that started up around Portsmouth
Square, to the days when the banks of the American
River swarmed with miners, and the gold lay
yellow in the prospector&#8217;s pan. He had worked
there shoulder to shoulder with men who afterwards
made the history of the state and men who
died with their names unknown. He had been an
eye witness of that blackest of Californian tragedies,
the lynching of a Spanish girl at Downieville,
had stood pallid and sick under a pine tree
and watched her boldly face her murderers and
meet her death.</p>

<p>The younger men, warmed to emulation, contributed
their stories. Perley had reminiscences
bequeathed to him by his father who had been an
alcalde in that transition year, when California
was neither state nor territory and stood in
unadministered neglect, waiting for Congress to
take some notice of her. Buford had stories of
the vicissitudes of a strolling player&#8217;s life. He had
been in the Klondike during the first gold rush
and told tales of mining in the North to match
those of mining on the &#8220;mother lode.&#8221; Willoughby,
thawed out of his original shyness, added
to the nights&#8217; entertainments stories of the
Australian bush, grim legends of the days of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
penal settlements at Botany Bay. Young Ryan
was the only man of the group who contributed
nothing to these Sierran Nights&#8217; Entertainments.
He sat silent in his chair, apparently listening, and,
under the shadow of the hand arched over his
eyes, looking at the girl opposite.</p>

<p>But the idyl had to end. Their captivity
passed into its third week, and signs that release
was at hand cheered them. They could go out.
The streets of Antelope were beaten into footpaths,
and the prisoners, with the enthusiasm of
children liberated from school, rushed into open-air
diversions and athletic exercise. The first
word from the outside world came by restored
telegraphic communication. Consolatory messages
poured in from San Francisco. Mrs. Ryan,
the elder, sent telegrams as long as letters and
showered them with the prodigality of an impassioned
gratitude on the camp. Perley had one
that he could not speak of without growing husky.
Willoughby had one that made him blush.
Dominick had several. None, however, had come
from his wife and he guessed that none had been
sent her, his remark to Rose to &#8220;let her alone&#8221;
having been taken as a wish to spare her anxiety.
It was thought that the mail would be in now in
a day or two. That would be the end of the fairy
tale. They sat about the fire on these last evenings
discussing their letters, what they expected,
and whom they would be from. No one told any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
more stories; the thought of news from &#8220;outside&#8221;
was too absorbing.</p>

<p>It came in the early dusk of an afternoon near
the end of the third week. Dominick, who was
still unable to walk, was standing by the parlor
window, when he saw Rose Cannon run past
outside. She looked in at him as she ran by, her
face full of a joyous excitement, and held up to his
gaze a small white packet. A moment later the
hall door banged, her foot sounded in the passage,
and she entered the room with a rush of cold air
and a triumphant cry of:</p>

<p>&#8220;The mail&#8217;s come!&#8221;</p>

<p>He limped forward to meet her and take from
her hand the letter she held toward him. For the
first moment he looked at her, not at the letter,
which dwindled to a thing of no importance when
their eyes met over it. Her face was nipped by the
keen outside air into a bright, beaming rosiness.
She wore on her head a man&#8217;s fur cap which was
pulled well down, and pressed wisps of fair hair
against her forehead and cheeks. A loose fur-lined
coat enveloped her to her feet, and after she had
handed him his letter she pulled off the mittens
she wore and began unfastening the clasps of the
coat, with fingers that were purplish and cramped
from the cold.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one for you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
waited till the postmaster looked all through them
twice. Then I made him give it to me and ran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
back here with it. The entire population of
Antelope&#8217;s in the post-office and there&#8217;s the
greatest excitement.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her coat was unfastened and she threw back
its long fronts, her figure outlined against the gray
fur lining. She snatched off her cap and tossed
it to an adjacent chair and with a quick hand
brushed away the hair it had pressed down on her
forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got seven,&#8221; she said, turning to the fire,
&#8220;and papa a whole bunch, and the judge,
quantities, and Willoughby, three. But only one
for you&mdash;poor, neglected man!&#8221;</p>

<p>Spreading her hands wide to the blaze she
looked at him over her shoulder, laughing teasingly.
He had the letter in his hands still
unopened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;what an extraordinary
sight! You haven&#8217;t opened it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered, turning it over, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always heard that curiosity was a feminine
weakness but I never knew it till now,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Please go on and read it, because if you
don&#8217;t I&#8217;ll feel that I&#8217;m preventing you and I&#8217;ll
have to go up stairs to my own room, which is as
cold as a refrigerator. Don&#8217;t make me polite and
considerate against my will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without answering her he tore open the letter
and, moving to the light of the window, held the
sheet up and began to read.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>There was silence for some minutes. The fire
sputtered and snapped, and once or twice the
crisp paper rustled in Dominick&#8217;s hands. Rose
held her fingers out to the warmth, studying them
with her head on one side as if she had never seen
them before. Presently she slid noiselessly out of
her coat, and dropped it, a heap of silky fur, on a
chair beside her. The movement made it convenient
to steal a glance at the young man. He
was reading the letter, his body close against the
window-pane, his face full of frowning, almost
fierce concentration. She turned back to the
fire and made small, surreptitious smoothings and
jerks of arrangement at her collar, her belt, her
skirt. Dominick turned the paper and there was
something aggressive in the crackling of the thin,
dry sheet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perley got a letter from your mother,&#8221; she
said suddenly, &#8220;that he was reading in a corner
of the post-office, and it nearly made him cry.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no answer. She waited for a space
and then said, projecting the remark into the
heart of the fire,</p>

<p>&#8220;Yours must be a most <i>interesting</i> letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>She heard him move and looked quickly back
at him, her face all gay challenge. It was met by
a look so somber that her expression changed as
if she had received a check to her gaiety as unexpected
and effectual as a blow. She shrank a
little as he came toward her, the letter in his hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>&#8220;It <i>is</i> an interesting letter,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
from my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since those first days of his illness, his wife&#8217;s
name had been rarely mentioned. Rose thought
it was because young Mrs. Ryan was a delicate
subject best left alone; Dominick, because anything
that reminded him of Berny was painful.
But the truth was that, from the first, the wife had
loomed before them as a figure of dread, a specter
whose presence congealed the something exquisite
and uplifting each felt in the other&#8217;s heart. Now,
love awakened, forcing itself upon their recognition,
her name came up between them, chilling
and grim as the image of death intruding suddenly
into the joyous presence of the living.</p>

<p>The change that had come over the interview
all in a moment was startling. Suddenly it seemed
lifted from the plane of every-day converse to a
level where the truth was an obligation and the
language of polite subterfuge could not exist.
But the woman, who hides and protects herself
with these shields, made an effort to keep it in the
old accustomed place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is&mdash;is&mdash;she well?&#8221; she stammered, framing
the regulation words almost unconsciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s well,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;she&#8217;s very well.
She wants me to come home.&#8221;</p>

<p>He suddenly looked away from her and, turning
to the chimneypiece, rested one hand upon it and
gazed down at the logs. A charred end projected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
and he pushed it in with his slippered foot, his
down-bent face, the lips set and brows wrinkled,
looking like the face of a sullen boy who has been
unjustly punished. An icy, invading chill of
depression made Rose&#8217;s heart sink down into
bottomless depths. She faltered in faint tones,</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll be there soon now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he answered without moving.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether I shall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know whether you&#8217;ll be home
soon? The roads are open; the postman has come
in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether I&#8217;ll go home,&#8221; he
repeated.</p>

<p>The snapping of the fire sounded loud upon the
silence that followed. The thrill of strong emotions
rising toward expression held them in a
breathless, immovable quietude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to go home?&#8221; said the young
girl. Her voice was low and she cleared her
throat. In this interchange of commonplace sentences
her heart had begun to beat so violently
that it interfered with the ease of her speech.</p>

<p>Dominick leaned forward and dropped the
crumpled letter into the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want to. I hate to.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this she did not reply at all, and after a
moment he continued: &#8220;My home is unbearable
to me. It isn&#8217;t a home. It&#8217;s a place where I
eat and sleep, and I&#8217;d prefer doing that anywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
else, in any dirty boarding-house or fourth-rate
hotel&mdash;I&#8217;d rather&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly and pushed the log farther
in. The letter was caught up the chimney in a
swirl of blackened scraps.</p>

<p>&#8220;But your wife?&#8221; said Rose.</p>

<p>This time her voice was hoarse but she did not
know it. She had lost the consciousness of herself.
It was a profound moment, the deepest she
had so far known, and all the forces of her being
were concentrated upon it. The young man
answered with deliberation, still not moving.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to see my wife. We are&mdash;we
are&mdash;uncongenial. There is nothing but unhappiness
between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you love her?&#8221; said the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I never did,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>For a moment neither dared speak. They did
not look at each other or stir. They hardly
seemed to breathe. A movement, a touch,
would have rent the last thin crust of reserve that
covered what were no longer unsuspected fires.
Dominick knew it, but the girl did not. She was
seized by what to her was a sudden, inexplicable
fear, and the increased, suffocating beating of her
heart made her feel dizzy. She suddenly wished
to fly, to escape from the room, and him, and
herself. She turned to go and was arrested by
Cora&#8217;s voice in the hall:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, you folks, are you in there?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>Cora&#8217;s visage followed her voice. She thrust it
round the door-post, beamingly smiling under a
recently-applied coat of powder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want to tackle a game of euchre?
Mr. Willoughby and I&#8217;ll lay you out cold unless
that British memory of his has gone back on him
and he&#8217;s forgot all I taught him last time.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were too bewildered to make any response.
Rose gathered up her coat and dropped it again,
looking stupidly from it to the intruder. Cora
turned back to the passage, calling,</p>

<p>&#8220;Here they are, Mr. Willoughby, all ready and
waiting for us. Now we&#8217;ll show them how to
play euchre.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Willoughby appeared, responsive to this
cheerful hail, Cora had pulled the chairs round the
table and brought out the cards. A few moments
later, they were seated and the game had begun.
Cora and her partner were soon jubilant. Not
only did they hold the cards, but their adversaries
played so badly that the tale of many old scores
was wiped off.</p>

<p>The next day the first movements of departure
began. Early in the afternoon Buford and Judge
Washburne started for Rocky Bar in Perley&#8217;s
sleigh. The road had been broken by the mail-carrier,
but was still so deeply drifted that the
drive was reckoned a toilsome undertaking not
without danger. Perley&#8217;s two powerful horses
were harnessed in tandem, and Perley himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
a mere pillar of wrappings, drove them, squatted
on a soap box in front of the two passengers.
There were cries of farewell from the porch and
tappings on the windows as the sleigh started
and sped away to the diminishing jingle of bells.
A sadness fell on those who watched it. The little
idyl of isolation was over.</p>

<p>On the following day Bill Cannon and his
daughter were to leave. A telegram had been
sent to Rocky Bar for a sleigh and horses of the
proper excellence to be the equipage of a Bonanza
Princess. Rose had spent the morning packing
the valises, and late in the afternoon began a
down-stairs search for possessions left in the parlor.</p>

<p>The dusk was gathering as she entered the
room, the corners of which were already full of
darkness, the fire playing on them with a warm,
varying light. Waves of radiance quivered and
ran up the ceiling, here and there touching the
glaze on a picture glass or china ornament. The
crude ugliness of the place was hidden in this
unsteady, transforming combination of shadow
and glow. It seemed a rich, romantic spot,
flushed with fire that pulsed on an outer edge of
mysterious obscurity, a center of familiar, intimate
life, round which coldness and the dark
pressed.</p>

<p>She thought the room was unoccupied and
advanced toward the table, then started before
the uprising of Dominick&#8217;s tall figure from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
chair in a shadowed corner. It was the first
time they had seen each other alone since their
conversation of the day before. Rose was startled
and agitated, and her brusk backward movement
showed it. Her voice, however, was natural,
almost easy to casualness as she said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought there was no one here, you&#8217;ve
hidden yourself in such a dark corner. I came
to gather up my books and things.&#8221;</p>

<p>He advanced into the light, looking somberly
at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true that you&#8217;re going to-morrow?&#8221; he
said almost gruffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, we&#8217;re really going. Everything&#8217;s
been arranged. Horses and a sleigh are expected
any moment now from Rocky Bar. They rest
here all night and take us down in the afternoon.
I think papa&#8217;d go crazy if we had to stay twenty-four
hours longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll follow in a day or two,&#8221; he said, &#8220;probably
go down on Tuesday, the doctor says.&#8221;</p>

<p>She began gathering up the books, reading the
titles, and putting aside those that were not hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry it&#8217;s over,&#8221; she said in a preoccupied
voice without any particular regret in it.
&#8220;<i>The Mill on the Floss</i> is Mrs. Perley&#8217;s, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, too,&#8221; he commented, very low.</p>

<p>She made no reply, selected another book, and
as she held it up looking at the back, said,</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s not like a regular good-by. It&#8217;s not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
as if you were going in one direction and we
in another. We&#8217;ll see you in San Francisco, of
course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>She laid the book on the table and turned her
face toward him. He stood looking into the fire,
not seeing the face, but conscious of it, of its
expression, of its every line.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that we&#8217;re not going to see you
down there at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s just about what I meant,&#8221; he
replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Ryan!&#8221; It was hardly more than a
breath of protest, but it was as stirring to the
man as the whisper of love.</p>

<p>He made no comment on it, and she said, with
a little more of insistence and volume,</p>

<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s best not,&#8221; he answered, and turned toward
her.</p>

<p>His shoulders were squared and he held his
head as a man does who prepares himself for a
blow. His eyes, looking straight into hers,
enveloped her in a glance soft and burning, not
a savage glance, but the enfolding, possessive
glance, caressing and ardent, pleading and masterful,
of a lover.</p>

<p>The books that she was holding fell to the
table, and they looked at each other while the
clock ticked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s best for me not to come,&#8221; he said huskily,
&#8220;never to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she faltered.</p>

<p>He came a little nearer to her and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned away, very pale, her lips trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;d like me to come if I could&mdash;if I
were free?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was close to her and looked down to see
her face, his own hard, the bones of the jaw showing
through the thin cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d like me to?&#8221; he urged.</p>

<p>She nodded, her lips too dry to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Rose!&#8221; he whispered, a whisper that
seemed to melt the strength of her heart and make
her unvanquished, maiden pride dissolve into
feebleness.</p>

<p>He leaned nearer and, taking her by the arms
just above the elbows, drew her to himself, into
an embrace, close and impassioned, that crushed
her against him. She submitted passively, in a
dizzy dream that was neither joy nor pain, but
was like a moment of drugged unreality, fearful
and beautiful. She was unconscious of his
lips pressed on her hair, but she felt the beating
of his heart beneath her cheek.</p>

<p>They stood thus for a moment, rising above
time and space. They seemed to have been
caught up to a pinnacle of life where the familiar
world lay far beneath them. A joy, divine and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
dreamy, held them clasped together, motionless
and mute, for a single point of time beyond and
outside the limitations that had heretofore bound
them.</p>

<p>Bill Cannon had a question to ask his daughter
and he came down stairs to the parlor where she
had told him she was going. He had dressed
himself for supper, the most important item of
his toilet being a pair of brown leather slippers.
They were soft and made no sound, and stepping
briskly in them he advanced to the half-open
parlor door, pushed it open and entered the quiet
room. On the hearth-rug before the fire stood a
woman clasped in the arms of Dominick Ryan.</p>

<p>Though the face was hidden, the first glance
told him it was his daughter. The young man&#8217;s
head was bowed on hers, his brown hair rising
above the gleaming blondness of hers. They
were absolutely motionless and silent. For an
amazed moment the father stared at them, then
turned and tiptoed out of the room.</p>

<p>He mounted several steps of the staircase and
then descended, stepping as heavily as he could,
and, as he advanced on the parlor, coughed with
aggressive loudness. He was on the threshold
when he encountered his daughter, her head
lowered, her gait quick, almost a run. Without
a word he stepped aside and let her pass, the
rustling of her skirt diminishing as she ran up the
hall and mounted the stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>Dominick was standing on the hearth-rug, his
head raised like a stag&#8217;s; his eyes, wide and
gleaming, on the doorway through which she had
passed. Cannon stopped directly in front of him
and fixed a stony, menacing glare on him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Dominick Ryan,&#8221; he said in a low voice,
&#8220;I saw that. I came in here a moment ago and
saw that. What have you got to say about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man turned his eyes slowly from
vacancy to the angry face before him. For a
moment he looked slightly dazed, staring blankly
at Cannon. Then wrath gathered thunderously
on his brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me alone!&#8221; he said fiercely, thrusting him
aside. &#8220;Get out of my way and let me alone!
I can&#8217;t talk to you now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He swept the elder man out of his path, and,
lurching and staggering on his wounded feet,
hurled himself out of the room.</p>

<small>THE SONS OF THEIR FATHERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was at the end of the Bonanza times, that
period of startling upheavals and downfalls, when
miners had suddenly become millionaires, and
rich men found themselves paupers, that Bill
Cannon built his mansion in San Francisco. He
had made his fortune in Virginia City, not in a
few meteoric years, as the public, who loves
picturesque histories, was wont to recount
relishingly, but in a series of broken periods of
plenty with lean years in between. The Crown
Point and Belcher rise made him a man of
means, and its collapse was said to have ruined
him. Afterward, wiseacres shook their heads
and there were rumors that it was not Bill Cannon
who was ruined. In the dead period which followed
this disastrous cataclysm of fortune and
confidence, he was surreptitiously loyal to the
capricious town from which men had withdrawn
their affection and belief as from a beguiling
woman, once loved and trusted, now finally
proved false.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>In those short years of mourning and lost faith
between the downfall of Crown Point and the
rise of the Con. Virginia and the Rey del
Monte, Bill Cannon &#8220;lay low.&#8221; His growing
reputation as an expert mining man and a rising
financier had suffered. Men had disbelieved in
him as they did in Virginia, and he knew the
sweetness of revenge when he and the great camp
rose together in titanic partnership and defied
them. His detractors had hardly done murmuring
together over the significant fact that Crown
Point &#8220;had not scooped every dollar he had&#8221;
when the great ore-body was struck on the
thousand-foot level of the Rey del Monte, and
Bill Cannon became a Bonanza King.</p>

<p>That was in seventy-four. The same year he
bought the land in San Francisco and laid the
foundation for the mansion on Nob Hill. His
wife was still living then, and his son and daughter&mdash;the
last of seven children, five of whom had
died in infancy&mdash;were as yet babies. A year
later the house was completed and the Cannon
family, surrounded by an aura of high-colored,
accumulating anecdote, moved down from Nevada
and took possession.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cannon, who in her girlhood had been
the prettiest waitress in the Yuba Hotel at
Marysville and had married Bill Cannon when he
was an underground miner, was the subject of
much gossip in the little group which at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
that time made up San Francisco&#8217;s fashionable
world. They laughed at her and went to her
entertainments. They told stories of her small
social mistakes, and fawned on her husband for
positions for their sons. He understood them,
treated them with an open cynical contempt,
and used them. He was big enough to realize
his wife&#8217;s superiority, and it amused him to punish
them for their patronizing airs by savage impertinences
that they winced under but did not dare
resent. She was a silent, sensitive, loving woman,
who never quite fitted into the frame his wealth
had given her. She did her best to fill the new
r&ocirc;le, but it bewildered her and she did not feel
at ease in it. In her heart she yearned for the
days when her home had been a miner&#8217;s cabin
in the foot-hills, her babies had known no nurse
but herself, and her husband had been all hers.
Those were her <i>beaux jours</i>.</p>

<p>She died some twelve years after the installation
in San Francisco. Bill Cannon had loved
her after his fashion and always respected her,
and the withdrawal of her quiet, sympathetic
presence left a void behind it that astonished,
almost awed him. The two children, Eugene
and Rose, were eighteen and thirteen at the time.
She had adored them, lived for them, been a
mother at once tender and intelligent, and they
mourned her with passion. It was to dull the
ache left by her death, that Gene, a weak and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
characterless changeling in this vigorous breed,
sought solace in drink. And it was then that Rose,
assuming her mother&#8217;s place as head of the
establishment, began to show that capacity for
management, that combination of executive power
and gentle force&mdash;bequests from both parents&mdash;that
added admiration to the idolizing love the
Bonanza King had always given her.</p>

<p>The house in which this pampered princess
ruled was one of those enormous structures which
a wealth that sought extravagant ways of expending
itself reared upon that protuberance in the
city&#8217;s outline called by San Franciscans Nob
Hill. The suddenly-enriched miners of the Comstock
Lode and the magnates of the railway had
money waiting for investment, and the building
of huge houses seemed as good a one as any
other.</p>

<p>Here, from their front steps, they could see the
city sweeping up from its low center on to the
slopes of girdling hills. It was a gray city,
crowding down to the edge of the bay, which,
viewed from this height, extended far up into
the sky. In summer, under an arch of remote,
cold blue, its outlines blurred by clouds of blown
dust, it looked a bleak, unfriendly place, a town
in which the stranger felt a depressing, nostalgic
chill. In winter, when the sun shone warm and
tender as a caress, and the bay and hills were like
a mosaic in blue and purple gems, it was a panorama<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
over which the passer-by was wont to linger.
The copings of walls offered a convenient resting-place,
and he could lean on them, still as a lizard
in the bath of sun.</p>

<p>Bill Cannon&#8217;s house had unbroken command of
this view. It fronted on it in irregular, massive
majesty, with something in its commanding bulkiness
that reminded one of its owner. It was of
that epoch when men built their dwellings of
wood; and numerous bay-windows and a sweep
of marble steps flanked by sleeping stone lions
were considered indispensable adjuncts to the
home of the rich man who knew how to do things
correctly. Round it spread a green carpet of
lawns, close-cropped and even as velvet, and
against its lower story deep borders of geraniums
were banked in slopes of graduated scarlet and
crimson. The general impression left by it was
that of a splendor that would have been ostentatious
and vulgar had not the studied elegance of
the grounds and the outflung glories of sea, sky
and hills imparted to it some of their own distinction
and dignity.</p>

<p>On the day following their departure from
Antelope, Cannon and his daughter reached home
at nightfall. The obsequiously-welcoming butler&mdash;an
importation from the East that the
Bonanza King confided to Rose he found it
difficult to refrain from kicking&mdash;acquainted
them with the fact that &#8220;Mr. Gene had been up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
from San Luis Obispo&#8221; for two days, waiting
for their arrival. Even as he spoke a masculine
voice uttered a hail from the floor above and a
man&#8217;s figure appeared on the stairway and ran
quickly down. Cannon gave a careless look
upward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah there, Gene,&#8221; he observed, turning to the
servant who was helping him off with his coat.
&#8220;Come up to town for a spell?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man did not seem to notice anything
especially ungracious in the greeting or probably
was used to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, just up for a look around and to see
how you and Rosey were. Got snowed in,
didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; he said, looking at his sister.</p>

<p>She kissed him affectionately and drew him to
the light where she subjected him to a sharp,
exploring scrutiny. Evidently the survey was
satisfactory, for she gave him a little slap on the
shoulder and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Good boy, Gene, San Luis is agreeing with
you. Yes, we were snowed in for nearly three
weeks. Papa&#8217;s been half crazy. And you&#8217;ve
been in town two days, Prescott says. It must
have been dull here all alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I haven&#8217;t been dull. I&#8217;ve been going
round seeing the boys and&#8221;&mdash;his sister&#8217;s sudden,
uneasy look checked him and he answered it
with quick reassurance of glance and tone.
&#8220;Everything strictly temperance. Don&#8217;t you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
get uneasy. I&#8217;ve lived up to my promises. The
ranch is mine all right, father.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had a high, rather throaty voice, which,
without seeing his face, would have suggested
weakness and lack of purpose. Now as he looked
at his father with a slight and somewhat foolish
air of triumph, the old man responded to his
remark with a sound which resembled a grunt
of scornful incredulity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Gene,&#8221; said his sister, her manner of
fond gratification in marked contrast to her
father&#8217;s roughness, &#8220;that&#8217;s the best news I&#8217;ve
heard for a year. It&#8217;s worth being snowed up to
hear that when you come out. Of course you&#8217;ll
get the ranch. I always knew you would. I
always knew you could pull up and be as straight
as anybody if you tried.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man, who had been kicking off his rubbers,
here raised his head with a bull-like movement,
and suddenly roared at the retreating butler
who was vanishing toward the dining-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;My cigars. Where in hell are they? Why
doesn&#8217;t somebody attend here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The servant, with a start of alarm and a murmured
excuse, disappeared for a moment, to
reappear, hurrying breathlessly with a box of
cigars. Cannon selected one and turned to the
stairway.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long are you down for?&#8221; he said to his
son as he began ascending.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>&#8220;I thought a week, perhaps two,&#8221; answered
the young man. &#8220;A feller gets darned lonely,
down there in the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something apologetic, almost pleading
in his words and way of speech. He looked
after his father&#8217;s receding figure as if quite oblivious
to the rudeness of the large, retiring back and
the manner of careless scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it three,&#8221; said the Bonanza King, turning
his head slightly and throwing the sentence
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Gene Cannon was now twenty-nine years of
age and had drunk since his eighteenth year.
His mother had died in ignorance of his vice.
When his father discovered it, it simply augmented
the old man&#8217;s impatience against the
feeble youth who would carry on his name and
be one of the inheritors of his fortune. Bill
Cannon had never cared much for his only son.
He had early seen the stuff of which the boy was
made. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t amount to a hill of beans,&#8221;
he would say, throwing the words at his wife
over the bitten end of his cigar. He could have
forgiven the drinking, as he could other vices, if
Gene had had some of his own force, some of
that driving power which had carried him triumphant
over friend and foe. But the boy had
no initiative, no brains, no energy. &#8220;How did
<i>I</i> ever come to have such a son?&#8221; he queried
sometimes in an access of disgust in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
surprise was stronger than the disgust. The
question possessed a sort of scientific interest for
him which was deeper than the personal and over
which the disappointed magnate would ponder.</p>

<p>As Gene grew older and his intemperance
assumed more serious proportions, the father&#8217;s
scorn grew more open and was augmented by a
sort of exasperated dislike. The Bonanza King
had no patience with those who failed from ill-health
or the persistent persecutions of bad luck.
His contention was that they should not have
been ill, and they should have conquered their
bad luck. He had no excuses for those who were
beaten back against the wall&mdash;only death should
be able to do that. But when it came to a useless,
hampering vice, a weakness that in itself was
harmless enough, but that was allowed to gain
paralyzing proportions, his original contempt was
intensified into a fierce intolerance which would
have been terrifying if it had not been tempered
with an indifferent disdain.</p>

<p>Rose&#8217;s attitude toward her brother was a source
of secret wonder to him. She loved the feeble
youth; a tie of the deepest affection existed
between them, upon which Gene&#8217;s intemperance
seemed to have no effect. The Bonanza King
had always admitted that the ways of the gentler
sex were beyond his comprehension, but that the
two women he had known best&mdash;his wife and his
daughter&mdash;should have lavished the tenderest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
love upon an intemperate, incompetent, useless
weakling was to him one of the fathomless mysteries
of life.</p>

<p>It was Rose&#8217;s suggestion that Gene should be
withdrawn from temptation by sending him to
the country. As the only son of Bill Cannon
he was the object of a variety of attentions and
allurements in the city to which a stronger-willed
man might have succumbed. The father
readily agreed to the plan. He could graciously
subscribe to all Rose said, as the removal of
Gene&#8217;s amiable visage and uninspired conversation
would not cause him any particular distress
or sense of loss.</p>

<p>But when Rose unfolded the whole of her
scheme he was not so enthusiastically in accord
with her. It was that Gene should be put on
his father&#8217;s ranch&mdash;the historic Rancho of the
Santa Trinidad near San Luis Obispo&mdash;as manager,
that all responsibility should be placed in his
hands, and that if, during one year&#8217;s probation,
he should remain sober and maintain a record of
quiet conduct and general good behavior, the
ranch should be turned over to him as his own
property, to be developed on such lines as he
thought best.</p>

<p>The Rancho of the Santa Trinidad was one of
the finest pieces of agricultural property in California.
The Bonanza King visited it once a year,
and at intervals received crates of fruit and spring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
chickens raised upon it. This was about all he
got out of it, but when he heard Rose calmly
arranging to have it become Gene&#8217;s property, he
felt like a man who suddenly finds himself being
robbed. He had difficulty in restraining a roar
of refusal. Had it been any one but Rose he
would not have restrained it.</p>

<p>Of course he gave way to her, as he always did.
He even gave way gracefully with an effect of a
generosity too large to bother over trifles, not
because he felt it but because he did not want
Rose to guess how it &#8220;went against him.&#8221;
Under the genial blandness of his demeanor he
reconciled himself to the situation by the thought
that Gene would certainly never keep sober for
a year, and that there was therefore no fear of
the richest piece of ranch land in the state passing
into the hands of that dull and incapable young
man.</p>

<p>The year was nearly up now. It had but
three months to run and Gene&#8217;s record had been
exemplary. He had come to the city only twice,
when his father noticed with a jealously-watchful
eye that he had been resolutely abstemious in
the matter of liquor and that his interest in the
great property he managed had been the strongest
he had so far evinced in anything. The thought
that Gene might possibly live up to his side of
the bargain and win the ranch caused the old
man to experience that feeling of blank chagrin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
which is the state of mind of the unexpectedly
swindled. He felt like a king who has been
daringly and successfully robbed by a slave.</p>

<p>At dinner that evening Gene was very talkative.
He told of his life on the ranch, of its methodical
monotony, of its seclusion, for he saw little of
his neighbors and seldom went in to the town.
Rose listened with eager interest, and the old man
with a sulky, glowering attention. At intervals
he shot a piercing look at his boy, eying him
sidewise with a cogitating intentness of observation.
His remarks were few, but Gene was so
loquacious that there was little opportunity
for another voice to be heard. He prattled on
like a happy child, recounting the minutest details
of his life after the fashion of those who live
much alone.</p>

<p>In the light of the crystal lamp that spread a
ruffled shade of yellow silk over the center of the
table, he was seen to be quite unlike his father
or sister. His jet-black hair and uniformly pale
skin resembled his mother&#8217;s, but his face in its
full, rounded contours, slightly turned-up nose,
and eyebrows as thick as strips of fur, had a
heaviness hers had lacked. Some people thought
him good-looking, and there was a sort of unusual,
Latin picturesqueness in the combination of his
curly black hair, which he wore rising up in a
bulwark of waves from his forehead, his white
skin, and the small, dark mustache, delicate as an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
eyebrow, that shaded his upper lip. It was one
of his father&#8217;s grievances against him that he
would have made a pretty girl, and that his soft,
affectionate character would have been quite
charming in a woman. Now, listening to him, it
seemed to the older man as if it were just the kind
of talk one might expect from Gene. The father
had difficulty in suppressing a snort of derision
when he heard the young man recounting to
Rose his troubles with his Chinese cook.</p>

<p>Before dinner was over Gene excused himself
on the plea that he was going to the theater.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m such a hayseed now,&#8221; he said as he rose,
&#8220;that I don&#8217;t want to miss a thing. Haven&#8217;t
seen a play for six months and I&#8217;m just crazy
to see anything, <i>Monte Cristo</i>, <i>Uncle Tom&#8217;s
Cabin</i>, <i>East Lynne</i>. I&#8217;m not proud, anything&#8217;ll
suit me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you ever go into San Luis?&#8221; growled
his father sulkily. &#8220;They have plays there
sometimes, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, but I&#8217;m keeping out of harm&#8217;s way.
The boys in San Luis don&#8217;t know how it is with
me. They don&#8217;t understand and I&#8217;m not going
to put myself in the way of temptation. You
know, father, I <i>want that ranch</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned a laughing glance on his father;
and the old man, with a sheepishly-discomfited
expression, grunted an unintelligible reply and
bent over his plate.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>He did not raise his head till Gene had left the
room, when, looking up, he leaned back in his
chair and said with a plaintive sigh,</p>

<p>&#8220;What a damned fool that boy is!&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose was up in arms at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, papa, how can you say that! Especially
when you see how he&#8217;s improved. It&#8217;s
wonderful. He&#8217;s another man. You can tell in
a minute he&#8217;s not been drinking, he takes such an
interest in everything and is so full of work and
plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he?&#8221; said her father dryly. &#8220;Maybe so,
but that don&#8217;t prevent him from being a damned
fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re unjust to Gene. Why do you think
he&#8217;s a fool?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just because he happens to be one. You
might as well ask me why I think the sun rises
in the east and sets in the west. That&#8217;s what it
does, and when I say it does, I&#8217;m not criticizing
or complaining, I&#8217;m only stating the plain facts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose made a murmur of protest and he went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re queer cattle, you women. I suppose
a feller could live in the world a hundred years and
not understand you. There&#8217;s Delia Ryan, for
example, the brainiest woman I know, could give
most men cards and spades and beat &#8217;em hands
down. Last night at Rocky Bar they were telling
me that she&#8217;s written to the operator there and
told him she&#8217;ll get him a position here in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
Atlantic and Pacific Cable Company, in which she&#8217;s
a large stock-holder, that&#8217;ll double his salary and
give him a chance he&#8217;d never have got in this
world. She wants to pay off a mortgage on a
ranch Perley has in the Sacramento Valley and
she&#8217;s sent Mrs. Perley a check for five hundred
dollars. She&#8217;s offered Willoughby a first-rate job
on the Red Calumet group of mines near Sonora
in which Con had a controlling interest, and
she&#8217;s written to the doctor to come down and
become one of the house physicians of the St.
Filomena Hospital, which she practically runs.
She&#8217;s ready to do all this because of what they
did for Dominick, and yet she, his own mother,
won&#8217;t give the boy a cent and keeps him on starvation
wages, just because she wants to spite
his wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at his daughter across the table with
narrowed eyes. &#8220;What have you got to say for
yourself after that, young woman?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>Rose had evidently nothing to say. She raised
her eyebrows and shook her head by way of reply.
Her face, in the flood of lamplight, looked pale
and tired. She was evidently distrait and
depressed; a very different-looking Rose from the
girl he had taken away with him four weeks
earlier. He regarded her for an anxiously-contemplative
moment and then said,</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? Seems to me you look
sort&#8217;er peaked.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>&#8220;I?&#8221; she queried with a surprised start.
&#8220;Why, I&#8217;m quite well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8217;s you were before you went up to the
mines?&#8221;</p>

<p>A color came into her cheeks and she lowered
her eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a little tired, I think, and that always
makes me look pale. It was a hard sort of trip,
all those hours in the sleigh, and that hotel at
Rocky Bar was a dreadful place. I couldn&#8217;t
sleep. There was a cow somewhere near&mdash;it
sounded as if it were in the next room&mdash;and the
roosters all began to crow in the middle of the
night. I&#8217;ll be all right to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her father drew his coffee-cup toward him and
dropped in a lump of sugar. No word had passed
between him and his daughter as to the scene he
had witnessed two days before in the parlor of
Perley&#8217;s Hotel. She was ignorant of the fact
that he had seen it and he intended that she should
remain ignorant of it. But the next morning he
had had an interview with Dominick Ryan, in
which the young man, confronted with angry
questions and goaded past reserve by shame and
pain, had confessed the misery of his marriage
and the love that in an unguarded moment had
slipped beyond his control.</p>

<p>Cannon had said little to him. Beyond telling
him that he must not see Miss Cannon again, his
comments on Dominick&#8217;s confessions had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
brief and non-committal. It was not his business
to preach to Delia Ryan&#8217;s boy, and a large experience
of men had given him a practically limitless
tolerance of any and all lapses of which the
human animal is capable. They only concerned
him as they bore on his own affairs. In this
particular case they did bear on his affairs,
closely and importantly, on the affair of all others
dearest and nearest to him&mdash;the happiness of his
daughter. He knew that in this three weeks of
imprisonment she had come to feel for Dominick
Ryan a sentiment she had never before felt for
any man. He had seen her in the young man&#8217;s
arms, and, knowing Rose as he knew her, that was
enough.</p>

<p>Driving down from Antelope in the sleigh he
thought about it hard, harder than he had ever
before in his life thought of any sentimental
complication. He was enraged&mdash;coldly and grimly
enraged&mdash;that his girl should have stumbled
into such a pitfall. But it was not his habit to
waste time and force in the indulgence of profitless
anger. The thing had happened. Rose, who
had been courted many times and never warmed
to more than pity for her unsuccessful suitors,
had suddenly, by a fateful, unpremeditated chance,
met her mate&mdash;the man she loved. And the
most maddening part of it was that he was the
man of all others her father would have chosen
for her had such a choice been possible.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>He bit on his cigar, turning it over between
his teeth, and looked sidewise at her as she sat
silent in the sleigh beside him. She was unquestionably
pale, pale and listless, her body wrapped
in enveloping furs, sunk in an attitude of weariness,
her eyes full of dejected reverie. Even to his
blindly-groping, masculine perceptions her distrait
looks, her dispirited silence, told of melancholy
preoccupation. She was not happy&mdash;his
Rose, who, if she had wanted it and he could
have bought, begged or stolen it, would have had
the moon.</p>

<p>To-night, in her white dress, the mellow radiance
of the lamp throwing out her figure against the
shadowy richness of the dining-room walls, she
bore the same appearance of despondency. Her
luster was dimmed, her delicate skin had lost its
dazzling, separated bloom of pink and white,
her glance was absent and unresponsive. Never,
since the death of her mother, now ten years back,
had he seen her when it was so obvious that she
harbored an inner, unexpressed sense of trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess the city&#8217;s the best place for you,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Roughing it don&#8217;t seem to suit you
if cows and chickens keep you awake all night.
I&#8217;ve seen the time when the hotel at Rocky Bar
would have been considered the top notch of
luxury. I wish you could see the places your
mother lived in when I first took her up there.
You&#8217;re a spoiled girl, Rose Cannon.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>&#8220;Who spoiled me, I wonder?&#8221; she said, looking
at him with a gleam of humor in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not calling names to-night,&#8221; he
answered, &#8220;anyway, not since Gene&#8217;s gone. All
my desire to throw things and be ugly vanishes
when that boy gets out. So the noises at
Rocky Bar kept you awake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I was wakeful, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked down at her cup, stirring her coffee.
He thought she appeared conscious and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;What made you wakeful, guilty conscience?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guilty conscience!&#8221; she repeated in a tone
that was full of indignant surprise. &#8220;Why should
I have a guilty conscience?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord knows! Don&#8217;t fire off these conundrums
at me. I don&#8217;t know all your secrets, honey.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not answer. He glanced furtively at
her and saw that her face had flushed. He took
a cigar from the box the butler had set at his
elbow and bit off the end:</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I know the secrets of a young
lady like you? A long time ago, perhaps, I used
to, after your mother died and you were my little
Rosey, fourteen years old. Lord, how cunning
you were then! Just beginning to lengthen out,
a little woman and a little girl, both in one. You
didn&#8217;t have secrets in those days or wakeful nights
either.&#8221;</p>

<p>He applied a match to the end of the cigar and
drew at it, his ears strained for his daughter&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
reply. She again made none and he shot a quick
glance at her. She was still stirring her coffee,
her eyebrows drawn together, her eyes on the
swirl of brown in the cup. He settled himself
in his chair, a bulky figure, his clothes ribbed
with creases, his head low between his shoulders,
and a reek of cigar smoke issuing from his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you like it up there, anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Up where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Up at Antelope. It was a sort of strange,
new experience for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I liked it so much&mdash;I loved part of it.
I liked the people much better than the people
down here, Mrs. Perley, and Cora, and Perley,
and Willoughby&mdash;did you ever know a nicer man
than Willoughby?&mdash;and Judge Washburne. <i>He</i>
was a real gentleman, not only in his manners but
down in his heart. And even Perley&#8217;s boy, he
was so natural and awkward and honest. I felt
different from what I do here, more myself, less
as if outside things were influencing me to do
things I didn&#8217;t always like to do or mean to do.
I felt as if I were doing just what I ought to do&mdash;it&#8217;s
hard to express it&mdash;as if I were being true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said her father with a falling inflection
which had a sound of significant comprehension.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what I mean?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can make a sort of guess at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He puffed at his cigar for a moment, then took
it from his mouth, eyed the lit end, and said,</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>&#8220;How&#8217;d you like Dominick Ryan? You
haven&#8217;t said anything about him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice, in answering, sounded low and careful.
She spoke slowly, as if considering her words:</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought he was very nice, and good-looking,
too. He&#8217;s not a bit like Cornelia Ryan, or his
mother, either. Cornelia has such red hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, looks like the old man. Good deal like
him in character, too. Con Ryan was the best
feller in the world, but not hard enough, not
enough grit. His wife had it though, had enough
for both. If it hadn&#8217;t been for her, Con would
never have amounted to anything&mdash;too soft and
good-natured, and the boy&#8217;s like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; She raised her head and looked
directly at him, her lips slightly parted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soft, too, just the same way, soft-hearted.
An easy mark for any one with a hard-luck story
and not too many scruples. Why did he marry
that woman? I don&#8217;t know anything about it,
but I&#8217;d like to bet she saw the stuff he was made
of and cried and teased and nagged till she got
him to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that he could have done anything
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a woman&#8217;s&mdash;a young girl&#8217;s view.
That&#8217;s the view Dominick himself probably took.
It&#8217;s the sort of idea you might expect him to
have, something ornamental and impractical,
that&#8217;s all right to keep in the cupboard and take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
out and dust, but that don&#8217;t do for every-day use.
That sort of thing is all very well for a girl, but
it doesn&#8217;t do for a man. It&#8217;s not for this world
and our times. Maybe it was all right when a
feller went round in armor, fighting for unknown
damsels, but it won&#8217;t go in California to-day.
The woman was a working woman, she wasn&#8217;t
any green girl. She earned her living in an office
full of men, and I guess there wasn&#8217;t much she
didn&#8217;t know. She saw through Dominick and
gathered him in. It&#8217;s all very well to be chivalrous,
but you don&#8217;t want to be a confounded
fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you a &#8216;confounded fool&#8217; when you&#8217;re
doing what you think right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It depends on what you think right, honey.
If it&#8217;s going to break up your life, cut you off
from your kind, make an outcast of you from
your own folks, and a poverty-stricken outcast
at that, you&#8217;re a confounded fool to think it&#8217;s
right. You oughtn&#8217;t to let yourself think so.
That kind of a moral attitude is a luxury. Women
can cultivate it because they don&#8217;t have to get
out in the world and fight. They keep indoors
and get taken care of, and the queer ideas they
have don&#8217;t hurt anybody. But men&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped, realizing that perhaps he was
talking too frankly. He had long known that
Rose harbored these Utopian theories on duty and
honor, which he thought very nice and pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
for her and which went gracefully with her character
as a sheltered, cherished, and unworldly
maiden. It was his desire to see what effect
the conversation was having on her that made
him deal so unceremoniously with ideals of
conduct which were all very well for Bill Cannon&#8217;s
daughter but were ruinous for Dominick Ryan.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you live in the world you&#8217;ve got to cut
your cloth by its measure,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Look
at that poor devil, tied to a woman that&#8217;s not going
to let him go if she can help it, that he doesn&#8217;t
care for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know he doesn&#8217;t care for her?&#8221;
The interruption came in a tone of startled surprise
and Rose stared at him, her eyes wide with it.</p>

<p>For a moment the old man was at a loss. He
would have told any lie rather than have let her
guess his knowledge of the situation and the
information given him by Dominick. He realized
that his zeal had made him imprudently garrulous,
and, gazing at her with a slightly stupid expression,
said in a slow tone of self-justification,</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s my idea. I guessed it. I&#8217;ve
heard one thing and another here and there and
I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that there&#8217;s no love
lost between them. It&#8217;s the natural outcome of
the situation, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, perhaps,&#8221; she murmured. She placed
her elbow on the table and pressed the tips of
her fingers against her cheek. Her hand and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
arm, revealed by her loose lace sleeve, looked as
if cut out of ivory.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then,&#8221; went on her father remorselessly,
&#8220;the results of being a confounded fool don&#8217;t
stop right there. That&#8217;s one of the worst things
of allowing yourself the luxury of foolishness.
They go on&mdash;roll right along like a wheel started
on a down-hill grade. Some day that boy&#8217;ll meet
the right woman&mdash;the one he really wants, the
one that belongs to him. He&#8217;ll be able to stand
it all right till then. And then he&#8217;ll realize just
what he&#8217;s done and what he&#8217;s up against, and
things may happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The smoke wreaths were thick in front of his
face, and peering through them he saw the young
girl move her fingers from her cheek to her forehead,
where she gently rubbed them up and down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that about the size of it?&#8221; he queried,
when she did not answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, maybe,&#8221; she said in a voice that sounded
muffled.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be a pretty tough proposition and it&#8217;s
bound to happen. A decent feller like that is
just the man to fall in love. And he&#8217;d be good
to a woman, he&#8217;d make her happy. He&#8217;s a good
husband lost for some nice girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose&#8217;s fingers ceased moving across her forehead.
Her hand rested there, shading her eyes.
For a moment the old man&mdash;his vision precipitated
into the half-understood wretchedness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
Dominick Ryan&#8217;s position&mdash;forgot her, and he
said in a hushed voice of feeling,</p>

<p>&#8220;By God, I&#8217;m sorry for the poor boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>His daughter rose suddenly with a rustling of
crushed silks. The sound brought him back in
an instant and he leaned over the arm of his
chair, his cigar in his left hand, his right waving
the smoke wreaths from before his face. Rose&#8217;s
hand, pressing her crumpled napkin on the table,
shone pink in the lamplight, her shoulder gleamed
white through its lace covering, but her face was
averted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going up now?&#8221; he asked, leaning still farther
over the chair-arm to see her beyond the lamp&#8217;s
wide shade.</p>

<p>She appeared not to hear and moved toward
the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going to bed already, Rosey?&#8221; he asked in
a louder key.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m tired,&#8221; her voice came a little hoarse
and she did not look at him. At the doorway
she stopped, her hand on the edge of the porti&egrave;re,
and without turning, cleared her throat and said,
&#8220;The cow and the chickens were too much
for me. I&#8217;m too sleepy to talk any more. Good
night, papa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, Rosey,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>The porti&egrave;re fell softly behind her, and her
footfall was lost in the thickness of the carpets.
Though he had not seen her face, her father had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
an alarming, an almost terrifying idea, that his
darling had left the table in tears.</p>

<p>He sat on for some time, stonily motionless,
save for the movement of his lips as he puffed
out clouds of smoke. The soft-footed servants,
coming to clear the table, fled before his growled
command to &#8220;get out and let him alone.&#8221; As
he smoked he looked straight before him with
fixed, unwinking eyes, his face set in furrows of
thought. At long intervals he stirred in his
chair, ponderously, like an inert, heavy animal,
and now and then he emitted a short sound, like
a grunted comment on some thought, which, by
its biting suddenness, seemed to force an ejaculation
out of him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>DOMINICK COMES HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Three days after the return of the Cannons,
Dominick Ryan also came home. He had
answered Berny&#8217;s letter the day the Cannons
left, a few hours after that interview with the
Bonanza King, in which, driven to bay by the
old man&#8217;s questions, he had torn the veil from
his married life.</p>

<p>After that there was a period of several hours
when he sat in his room thinking over what had
happened. It seemed to him that he had played
a dastardly part. He saw himself a creature of
monumental, gross selfishness, who had cajoled
a young girl, in a moment of softness and sentiment,
into an action which had done nothing but
distress and humiliate her. He, who should have
been the strong one, had been weak. It was he
who should have seen how things were going; he,
the married man, who had allowed himself to
feel and to yield to a love that ought to have
been hidden for ever in his own heart.</p>

<p>He felt that it would be a sort of expiation to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
go back to his wife. That was where he belonged.
Rose must never again cross his path, have a
place in his thoughts, or float, a soft beguiling
image, in his memory. He had a wife. No
matter what Berny was, she was the woman he
had married. She had not deceived him. It
was he who had done her a wrong, and he owed
her a reparation.</p>

<p>In his raw state, his nerves still thrilling with
the memory of that moment&#8217;s embrace, he saw
Berny from her own point of view. He lost the
memory of the complacent mistress in the picture
of the unloved wife, on whose side there
was much to be said. Morbidness colored his
vision and exaggerated his sense of culpability.
If she had an ugly temper, had it not been excited,
fed and aggravated by the treatment she had
received from his family? If they had maintained
a different attitude toward her, the poor
girl might have been quite a pleasant, easy-going
person. In all other ways she had been a good
wife. Since their marriage, no other man had
ever won a glance from her. She had often
enough assured Dominick of that fact, and he,
for his part, knew it to be true. She had struggled
to keep a comfortable home on their small income.
If she was not congenial to him&mdash;if her companionship
was growing daily more disagreeable&mdash;was
it all her fault? He had known her well
before he married her, six months of the closest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
intimacy had made him acquainted with every
foible of her character. It was no story of a
youth beguiled and deceived by a mature woman
in the unequal duel of a drawing-room courtship.</p>

<p>Her letter intensified his condition of self-accusation,
chafed and irritated his soreness of
shame till it became a weight of guilt. It also
stirred afresh the pity, which was the strongest
feeling he had for her. It was the tenderest, the
most womanly letter, Berny had ever written him.
A note of real appeal sounded through it. She
had humiliated herself, asked his pardon, besought
of him to return. As he thought of it, the vision
of her alone in the flat, bereft of friends, dully
devoid of any occupation, scornful of her old
companions, fawningly desirous of making new
ones who refused to know her, smote him with an
almost sickening sense of its pitifulness. He
felt sorry for her not alone because of her position,
but because of what she was, what her own disposition
had made her. She would never change,
her limitations were fixed. She would go on
longing for the same flesh-pots to the end, believing
that they represented the highest and best.</p>

<p>Berny had realized that her letter was a skilful
and moving production, but she did not know
that it was to gain a hundredfold in persuasive
power by falling on a guilty conscience. It put
an end to Dominick&#8217;s revolt, it quenched the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
last sparks of the mutinous rage which had taken
him to Antelope. That same afternoon in his
frigid bedroom at the hotel, he answered it.
His reply was short, only a few lines. In these
he stated that he would be back on the following
Saturday, the tenderness of his injured foot
making an earlier move impossible.</p>

<p>The letter reached Berny Friday and threw
her into a state of febrile excitement. Her
deadly dread of Dominick&#8217;s returning to his family
had never quite died out. It kept recurring,
sweeping in upon her in moods of depression, and
making her feel chilled and frightened. Now she
knew he was coming back to her, evidently not
lovingly disposed&mdash;the letter was too terse and
cold for that&mdash;but, at any rate, he was coming
home. Once there, she would set all her wits
to work, use every art of which she was mistress,
to make him forget the quarrel and enter in upon
a new era of sweet reasonableness and mutual
consideration.</p>

<p>She set about this by cleaning the house and
buying new curtains for the sitting-room. Such
purifications and garnishments would have agreeably
impressed her on a home-coming and she
thought they would Dominick. In the past year
she had become much more extravagant than
she had been formerly, a characteristic which
had arisen in her from a state of rasped irritation
against the restricted means to which Mrs. Ryan&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
rancor condemned her. She was quite heavily
in debt to various tradespeople; and to dressmakers
and milliners she owed sums that would
have astounded her husband had he known of
them. This did not prevent her from still further
celebrating his return by ordering a new dress
in which to greet him and a new hat to wear the
first time they went out together. How she was
to pay for these adornments, she did not know
nor care. The occasion was so important that
it excused any extravagance, and Berny, in whose
pinched, dry nature love of dress was a predominant
passion, was glad to have a reason for adding
new glories to her wardrobe.</p>

<p>On the Saturday morning she went out betimes.
Inquiry at the railway office told her that the
train which connected with the branch line to
Rocky Bar did not reach the city till six in the
evening. She ordered a dinner of the choicest
viands and spent part of the morning passing
from stall to stall in the market on Powell Street
spying about for dainties that might add a last
elaborating touch to the lengthy menu. The
afternoon was dedicated to the solemn rites of
massaging, manicuring, and hair-waving at a
beauty doctor&#8217;s. On an ordinary occasion these
unwonted exertions in the pursuit of good looks
would have tired her, but to-day she was keyed to
a pitch where she did not notice small outside
discomforts.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>Long before six she was dressed, and standing
before the mirror in her room she laid on the last
perfecting touches with a short stick of hard red
substance and a circular piece of mossy-looking
white stuff, which she rubbed with a rotary
motion round and round her face. Her new
dress of raspberry pink crape betrayed the hand
of an expert in its gracefully-falling folds and the
elegance with which it outlined her slim, long-waisted
shape. Her artificially-reddened hair
waved back from her forehead in glossy ripples;
her face, all lines and hollows rubbed from it,
looked fresh and youthful. With the subdued
light falling on her through the silk and paper
lamp shades, she looked a very pretty woman,
the darkness of her long brilliant eyes thrown
into higher relief by the whiteness of her powdered
face.</p>

<p>She was tremulously nervous. Every sound
caused her to start and move to that part of the
parlor whence she could look down the long
passageway to the stair-head. Large bunches of
greenery were massed here in the angles of the
hall and stood in the corners of the sitting-room.
Bowls filled with violets and roses were set on
the table and mantelpiece, and the scent of these
flowers, sweet and delicate, mingled with the
crude, powerful perfume that the woman&#8217;s draperies
exhaled with every movement. At intervals
she ran into her bedroom, seized the little, round,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
soft wad of white and rubbed it over her face
with a quick concentric movement, drawing her
upper lip down as she did so, which gave to her
countenance with its anxious eyes an exceedingly
comical expression.</p>

<p>It was nearly seven o&#8217;clock when the bell rang.
With a last hasty look in the glass, she ran down
the passageway to the stair-head. It was necessary
to descend a few steps to a turn on the stairs
from whence the lever that opened the door
could be worked. As she stood on the small
landing, thrown out in bright relief by a mass
of dark leafage that stood in the angle of the wall,
the door opened and Dominick entered. He
looked up and saw her standing there, gaily
dressed, a brilliant, animated figure, smiling down
at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Berny,&#8221; he said in a quiet, unemotional
voice, &#8220;is that you?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was certainly not an enthusiastic greeting.
A sensitive woman would have been shriveled
by it, but Berny was not sensitive. She
had realized from the start that she would
probably have to combat the lingering surliness
left by the quarrel. As Dominick ascended, her
air of smiling welcome was marked by a bland
cheery unconsciousness of any past unpleasantness.
She was not, however, as unconscious as
she looked. She noted his heaviness of demeanor,
the tired expression of his lifted face. He came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
up the stairs slowly, not yet being completely
recovered, and it added to the suggestion of
reluctance, of difficult and spiritless approach,
that seemed to encompass him in an unseen yet
distinctly-felt aura.</p>

<p>As he rose on a level with her, she stretched
out her hands and, laying them on his shoulders,
drew him toward her and kissed him. The
coldness of his cheek, damp with the foggy night
air, chilled the caress and she drew back from
him, not so securely confident in her debonair,
smiling assurance. He patted her lightly on the
shoulder by way of greeting and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you? All right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; she answered with brisk,
determined sprightliness. &#8220;You&#8217;re the one to
ask about. You walk stiff, still. How are your
feet?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was glad to turn her eyes away from his
face. It looked very tired, and the slight smile
with which he had greeted her stayed only on his
lips and did not extend to his fatigued eyes.
He was evidently angry still, angry and unforgiving,
and that he should be so, when she was so
anxious to forget the ugly episode of the quarrel
and be gay and friendly again, dashed her spirits
and made her feel unsure of herself and upset.
She was determined, however, to show him that
she had forgotten all about it, and as he turned
the angle of the stairway she thrust her hand inside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
his arm and walked up beside him. They might
have been a happy married couple, reunited after
an absence, slowly coming up the stairs together
arm in arm.</p>

<p>A few minutes later they were seated opposite
each other at dinner. The little table glowed
and gleamed, all Berny&#8217;s bravery of silver and
glass mustered for its adornment. The choice
and delicate dinner began with a soup that Dominick
especially liked, a fact which Berny hoped
he would notice and mention. She was one of
those women who have an unfailing memory
for what people like to eat; a single expression
of preference would remain in her mind for years.
Dominick and she had not lived together for a
month before she knew everything in the way
of food he liked or disliked. When she was
annoyed with him, or especially bitter against
his mother, she would order nothing but dishes
that he did not care for, and when she was in
a more friendly mood, as to-night, she would take
pains and time to arrange a menu composed of
those he preferred. He usually did not notice
these rewards and punishments, but Berny always
thought he did and was &#8220;too stubborn,&#8221; as she
expressed it to herself, to show that he was affected
by them.</p>

<p>She observed to-night that he neither remarked,
nor seemed to relish his food, but she made no
comment, talking on in a breathless, lively way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
asking questions of his trip, his accident, and
the condition of his feet, as though there were no
mortifying recollections connected with the cause
of his sudden departure. Her only indication of
embarrassment was a tendency to avoid anything
like a moment of silence and to fly from one subject
to another. Dominick answered her questions
and told her of his wanderings with a slow,
careful exactness. Save in the freezing of his
feet, which matter he treated more lightly than
it deserved, he was open with her in recounting
the small happenings of what he called &#8220;his
holiday,&#8221; from the time of his walk from Rocky
Bar to the day of his departure from Antelope.</p>

<p>They had progressed through the fish to the
entr&eacute;e when her questions passed from his personal
wanderings and adventures to his associates.
She had been very anxious to get to this point,
as she wanted to know what degree of intimacy
he had reached with the Bonanza King. Several
times already she had tried to divert the conversation
toward that subject, but it had been
deflected by the young man, who seemed to
find less personal topics more to his taste. Now
she was advancing openly upon it, inquiring about
the snow-bound group at Perley&#8217;s, and awarding
to any but the august name for which her ears
were pricked a perfunctory attention. It was
part of the natural perversity of man that Dominick
should shy from it and expend valuable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
time on descriptions of the other prisoners.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was an actor there,&#8221; he said, &#8220;snowed
in on his way to Sacramento, a queer-looking
chap, but not bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An actor?&#8221; said Berny, trying to look
interested. &#8220;What did he act?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Melodrama, I think. He told me he played
all through the northwest and east as far as
Denver. The poor chap was caught up there and
was afraid he was going to lose a Sacramento
engagement that I guess meant a good deal to
him. He was quite interesting, been in the Klondike
in the first rush and had some queer stories
about the early days up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny&#8217;s indifferent glance became bright and
fixed under the steadying effect of sudden interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Been in the Klondike?&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;What
was his name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Buford, James Defay Buford. He&#8217;d been an
actor at the opera house at Dawson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Buford,&#8221; said Berny, turning to place a helping
of pease on the plate the Chinaman held toward
her. &#8220;I never heard of him. I thought perhaps
it might have been some actor I&#8217;d seen play.
I&#8217;d like to know an actor in private life. They
must be so different.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ladled a second spoonful of pease on to
her own plate, and as she began to eat them, said,</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been interesting having the
Cannons up there. When I read in the paper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
that they were up at Antelope too, I was awfully
glad because I thought it would be such a good
thing for you to get to know the old man well,
as you would, snowed in that way together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew him before. My father and mother
have been friends of his for years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that. You&#8217;ve often told me. But
that&#8217;s a different thing. I thought if he got
to know you intimately and liked you, as he
probably would&#8221;&mdash;she glanced at him with a
coquettish smile, but his face was bent over his
plate&mdash;&#8220;why, then, something might come of it,
something in a business way.&#8221; She again looked
at him, quickly, with sidelong investigation,
to see how he took the remark. She did not
want to irritate him by alluding to his small
means, anyway on this night of reconciliation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be so useful for you to get solid
with a man like Bill Cannon,&#8221; she concluded with
something of timidity in her manner.</p>

<p>Despite her caution, Dominick seemed annoyed.
He frowned and gave his head an impatient jerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there was nothing of that kind,&#8221; he said
hurriedly. &#8220;We were just snowed in at the
same hotel. There was no question of intimacy
or friendship about it, any more than there was
between Judge Washburne and me, or even the
actor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny was exceedingly disappointed. Had the
occasion been a less momentous one she would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
have expressed herself freely. In her mind she
thought it was &#8220;just like Dominick&#8221; to have such
an opportunity and let it go. A slight color
deepened the artificial rose of her cheeks and for
a moment she had to exert some control to
maintain the silence that was wisdom. She
picked daintily at her food while she wrestled
with her irritation. Dominick showed no desire
to resume the conversation, and a silence of some
minutes&#8217; duration rested over them, until she
broke it by saying with a resolute cheerfulness
of tone,</p>

<p>&#8220;Rose Cannon was there too, the paper said.
I suppose you got to know her quite well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I saw a good deal of her.
There was only one sitting-room and we all sat
there. She was there with the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s she like?&#8221; said Berny, her curiosity
on the subject of this spoiled child of fortune
overcoming her recent annoyance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen her,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;you know
what she looks like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen her to know who she was.
I suppose I&#8217;ve passed her on the streets and at
the theaters. Is she cordial and pleasant, or does
she give herself airs because she&#8217;s Bill Cannon&#8217;s
daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dominick moved his feet under the table.
It was difficult for him to answer Berny&#8217;s questions
politely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t give herself the least airs. She&#8217;s
perfectly simple and natural and kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I&#8217;ve heard,&#8221; his wife said,
giving her head an agreeing wag. &#8220;They say
she&#8217;s just as easy and unassuming as can be.
Did you think she was pretty when you saw her
close to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Berny, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered the
victim in a tone of goaded patience. &#8220;She looks
just the same close to as she does at a distance.
I don&#8217;t notice people&#8217;s looks much. Yes, I
suppose she&#8217;s pretty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has blonde hair,&#8221; said Berny, leaning forward
over her plate in the eagerness of her interest.
&#8220;Did it look to you as if it was bleached?&#8221;</p>

<p>He raised his eyes, and his wife encountered an
unexpected look of anger in them. She shrank a
little, being totally unprepared for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I know whether her hair was
bleached or not?&#8221; he said sharply. &#8220;That&#8217;s a
very silly question.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny was quite taken aback.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that it is,&#8221; she said with unusual
and somewhat stammering mildness. &#8220;Most
blonde-haired women, even if they haven&#8217;t
bleached their hair, have had it &#8216;restored.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Dominick did not answer her. The servant
presented a dish at his elbow and he motioned
it away with an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>Berny, who was not looking at him, went on.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>&#8220;What kind of clothes did she wear? They
say she&#8217;s an elegant dresser, gets almost everything
from Paris, even her underwear. I suppose
she didn&#8217;t have her best things up there. But
she must have had something, because the papers
said they&#8217;d gone prepared for a two weeks&#8217; trip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never noticed anything she wore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, isn&#8217;t that just like you, Dominick
Ryan!&#8221; exclaimed his wife, unable, at this unmerited
disappointment, to refrain from some expression
of her feelings. &#8220;And you might know I&#8217;d
be anxious to hear what she had on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry, but I haven&#8217;t an idea about
any of her clothes. I think they were always
dark, mostly black or brown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you notice,&#8221; almost pleadingly, &#8220;what
she wore when she went out? Mrs. Whiting,
the forelady at Hazel&#8217;s millinery, says she imported
a set of sables, muff, wrap and hat, for her this
autumn. Hazel says it was just the finest thing
of its kind you ever laid your eyes on. Did she
have them up there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t possibly tell you. I don&#8217;t know
what sables are. I saw her once with a fur cap
on, but I think it belonged to Willoughby, an
Englishman who was staying there, and used to
have his cap hanging on the pegs in the hall.
It&#8217;s quite useless asking me these questions. I
don&#8217;t know anything about the subject. Did
you wind the clock while I was away?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>He looked at the clock, a possession of his own,
given him in the days when his mother and
sister delighted to ornament his rooms with costly
gifts and in which he had never before evinced the
slightest interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I wound it,&#8221; Berny said with an
air of hurt protest. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t I wound it regularly
for nearly three years?&#8221;</p>

<p>This brought the subject of Rose Cannon to
an end and she was not alluded to again during
the dinner. The conversation reverted to such
happenings in the city as Berny thought might
interest her husband, and it seemed to her that
he was more pleased to sit and listen to her chatter
of her sisters, the bank, the theaters, and the
shops, than to dilate any further on his adventures
in the snow-bound Sierra.</p>

<p>When the dinner was over, they returned to
the front of the flat, where next to the parlor
there was a tiny hall-room fitted up as a smoking-room
and den. It was merely a continuation of
the hall, and &#8220;the cozy corner&#8221; which Berny
had had a Polk Street upholsterer construct in
it, occupied most of the available space, and
crowded such visitors as entered it into the corners.
It had been Berny&#8217;s idea to have this room
&#8220;lined with books&#8221; as she expressed it, but their
joint possessions in this line consisting of some
twenty-five volumes, and the fact that the contracted
space made it impossible to accommodate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
both the books and the cozy corner, Berny had
decided in favor of the latter. She now seated
herself on the divan that formed the integral
part of this construction, and, piling the pillows
behind her, leaned luxuriously back under the
canopy of variegated stuffs which was supported
by two formidable-looking lances.</p>

<p>Dominick sat in his easy chair. He always
smoked in this room and read the papers, and
presently he picked them up from the table and
began to look them over. The conversation
languished, became spasmodic, and finally died
away. Berny, leaning back on the cushions, tried
several times to revive it, but her husband from
among the spread sheets of the evening press
answered her with the inarticulate sounds of
mental preoccupation, and sometimes with no
sound at all, till she abandoned the attempt
and leaned back under the canopy in a silence
that was not by any means the somnolent quietude
of after-dinner torpor.</p>

<p>The clock hands were pointing to half-past
nine when a ring at the bell was followed by the
appearance of the Chinaman at the door, stating
that the expressman had come with Mr.
Ryan&#8217;s valises. Dominick threw down his papers
and left the room. As Berny sat silent, she could
hear the expressman&#8217;s gruff deep voice in the hall
and the thuds of the valises as he thumped them
down at the stair-head. Dominick answered him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
and there were a few more remarks, followed by
the retreating sound of the man&#8217;s heavy feet on
the stairs and the bang of the hall door. She
sat looking at the clock, waiting for her husband
to return, and then as he did not come and the
hall seemed singularly quiet she leaned forward
and sent an exploring glance down its dim length.
Dominick was not there, but a square of light
fell out from the open doorway of his room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dominick,&#8221; she called, &#8220;what are you doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>He came to the door of the room in his shirt-sleeves,
a tall figure looking lean and powerful
in this closer-fitting and lighter garb.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m unpacking my things, and then I&#8217;m going
to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she answered with a falling inflection,
leaning forward, with her elbows planted on her
knees, craning her neck to see more plainly down
the narrow passageway. &#8220;It&#8217;s only half-past
nine; why do you want to go to bed so early?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired, and it will take me some time to
get these things put away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I help you?&#8221; she asked without moving.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thanks. There&#8217;s nothing much to bother
about. Good night, Berny,&#8221; and he stepped back
into the room and shut the door.</p>

<p>Berny sat as he had left her for a space, and
then drew back upon the divan and leaned against
the mound of pillows. She made the movement
charily and slowly, her face set in a rigidity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
thought to which her body seemed fixed and
obedient. She sat thus for an hour without
moving, her eyes staring before her, two straight
lines folded in the skin between her brows.</p>

<p>So he was still angry, angry and unforgiving.
That was the way she read his behavior. The
coldness that he exhaled&mdash;that penetrated even
her unsensitive outer shell&mdash;she took to be the
coldness of unappeased indignation. He had
never before been just like this. There was a
something of acquired forbearance and patience
about him&mdash;a cultivated thing, not a spontaneous
outward indication of an inner condition of
being&mdash;which was new to her observation. He
was not sulky or cross; he was simply withdrawn
from her and trying to hide it under a manner
of careful, guarded civility. It was different from
any state she had yet seen him in, but it never
crossed her mind that it might be caused by the
influence of another woman.</p>

<p>He was still angry&mdash;that was what Berny
thought; and sitting on the divan under the canopy
with its fiercely-poised lances she meditated on the
subject. His winning back was far from accomplished.
He was not as &#8220;easy&#8221; as she had always
thought. A feeling of respect for him entered
into her musings, a feeling that was novel, for
in her regard for her husband there had previously
been a careless, slighting tolerance which
was not far removed from contempt. But if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
he had pride enough to keep her thus coldly at
arm&#8217;s length, to withstand her attempts at forgiveness
and reconciliation, he was more of a
man than she thought, and she had a harder task
to handle than she had guessed. She did not
melt into anything like self-pity at the futility
of her efforts, which, had Dominick known of
them, would have seemed to him extremely
pathetic. That they had not succeeded gave her
a new impetus of force and purpose, made her
think, and scheme with a hard, cool resolution.
To &#8220;make up&#8221; and gain ascendancy over Dominick,
independent and proudly indifferent, was
much more worth while than to bully Dominick,
patient, enduring, and ruled by a sense of duty.</p>

<small>THE GODS IN THE MACHINE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>On the second Sunday after their return from
Antelope, Bill Cannon resolved to dedicate the
afternoon to paying calls. This, at least, was
what he told his daughter at luncheon as he, she,
and Gene sat over the end of the meal. To pay
calls was not one of the Bonanza King&#8217;s customs,
and in answer to Rose&#8217;s query as to whom he
was going to honor thus, he responded that he
thought he&#8217;d &#8220;start in with Delia Ryan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose made no comment on this intelligence.
The sharp glance he cast at her discovered no suggestion
of consciousness in the peach-like placidity
of her face. It gratified him to see her thus
unsuspecting, and in the mellowing warmth of
his satisfaction he turned and addressed a polite
query to Gene as to how he intended spending
the afternoon. Gene and Rose, it appeared, were
going to the park to hear the band. Gene loved
a good band, and the one that played in the
park Sunday afternoons was especially good.
The Sunday before, Gene had heard it play <i>Poet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
and Peasant</i> and the <i>Overture of William Tell</i>,
and it was great! That was one of the worst
things about living on a ranch, Gene complained,
you didn&#8217;t have any music except at the men&#8217;s
house at night when one of the Mexicans played
on an accordion.</p>

<p>The old man, with his elbow on the table, and
a short, blunt-fingered hand stroking his beard,
looked at his son with narrowed eyes full of
veiled amusement. When he did not find Gene
disagreeably aggravating as his only failure, he
could, as it were, stand away from him and
realize how humorous he was if you took him in
a certain way.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the Mexican play?&#8221; he growled
without removing his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>La Paloma</i>,&#8221; answered Gene, pleased to be
questioned thus amicably by his autocratic sire,
&#8220;generally <i>La Paloma</i>, but he <i>can</i> play <i>The
Heart Bowed Down</i> and the Toreador song
from <i>Carmen</i>. I want him to learn the <i>Miserere</i>
from <i>Trovatore</i>. It&#8217;s nice to sit on the porch
after dinner and listen while you smoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sort of Court Minstrel,&#8221; said his father,
thumping down his napkin with his hand spread
flat on it. &#8220;Don Eugenio Cannon, with his
minstrel playing to him in the gloaming! It&#8217;s
very picturesque. Did you ever think of having
a Court Fool too, or perhaps you don&#8217;t feel as
if you needed one?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>He arose from his chair before Gene, who never
quite understood the somewhat ferocious humor
of his parent, had time to reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, so long,&#8221; said the old man; &#8220;be good
children and don&#8217;t get into mischief, and Rose,
see that your brother doesn&#8217;t get lost or so carried
away by the <i>Poet and the Peasant</i> that he
forgets the dinner hour. <i>Adios</i>, girlie.&#8221;</p>

<p>A half-hour later he walked down the flight
of marble steps that led in dignified sweep from
the front door to the street. It was a wonderful
day and for a moment he paused, looking with
observing eyes at the prospect of hill and bay which
seemed to glitter in the extreme clearness of the
atmosphere. Like all Californians he had a
strong, natural appreciation of scenic and climatic
beauty. Preoccupied with thoughts and schemes
which were anything but uplifting, he yet was
sensitively responsive to the splendors of the view
before him, to the unclouded, pure blue of the
vault above, to the balmy softness of the air
against his face. Some one had once asked him
why he did not live in Paris as the ideal home
of the man of great wealth and small scruples.
His answer had been that he preferred San
Francisco because there were more fine days in
the year there than anywhere else he knew of.</p>

<p>Now he paused, sniffing the air with distended
nostril and inhaling it in deep, grateful inspirations.
His eye moved slowly over the noble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
prospect, noted the deep sapphire tint of the
bay, the horizon, violet dark against a pale sky,
and the gem-like blues and amethysts of the
distant hills. He turned his glance in the other
direction and looked down the gray expanse of
the street, the wide, clear, stately street, with
its air of clean spaciousness, sun-bathed, silent,
almost empty, in the calm quietude of the Sabbath
afternoon. The bustling thoroughfares of
greater cities, with their dark, sordid crowds,
their unlovely, vulgar hurry, their distracting
noise, were offensive to him. The wonder crossed
his mind, as it had done before, how men who
could escape from such surroundings chose to
remain in them.</p>

<p>He walked forward slowly, a thick-set, powerful
figure, his frock-coat buttoned tight about the
barrel-like roundness of his torso, a soft, black
felt hat pulled well down on his head. His feet
were broad and blunt like his hands, and in their
square-toed shoes he planted them firmly on the
pavement with a tread of solid, deliberate authority.
His forward progress had something in it
of an invincible, resistless march. He was thinking
deeply as he walked, arranging and planning,
and there was nothing in his figure, or movements,
or the expression of his face, which suggested
the sauntering aimlessness of an afternoon
stroll.</p>

<p>When he turned into Van Ness Avenue the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
Ryan house was one block beyond him, a conglomerate
white mass, like a crumbling wedding cake
slowly settling on a green lawn. He surveyed
it as he approached, noting its ugliness with a
musing satisfaction. Its size and the bright
summery perfection of surrounding grass and
flower beds lent it impressiveness and redeemed
it from the position of a colossal blight on the
prospect to which architect and builder had done
their best to relegate it. Prosperity, a complacent,
overwhelming prosperity, was suggested not
only by its bulk but by the state of studied finish
and neatness that marked mansion and grounds.
There did not seem to be a wilting flower bed or
withered leaf left on a single stalk in the garden
borders. Every window-pane gleamed like a
mirror innocent of dust or blemishing spot. The
marble steps up which Cannon mounted were as
snowily unsullied as though no foot had passed
over them since their last ablution.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a Chinaman, who,
taking the visitor&#8217;s card, left him standing in the
hall, and, deaf to his queries as to where he should
go, serenely mounted the stairs. Cannon hesitated
a moment, then hearing a sound of voices to
his right, entered the anteroom that gave on
that suite of apartments into which Dominick
had walked on the night of the ball. They were
softly lit by the afternoon sun filtering through
thin draperies, and extended in pale, gilt-touched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
vista to the shining emptiness of the ball-room.
The old man was advancing toward the voices when
he suddenly saw whence they proceeded, and
stopped. In the room just beyond him Cornelia
Ryan and a young man were sitting on a
small, empire sofa, their figures thrown out in
high relief against the background of silk-covered
wall. Cornelia&#8217;s red head was in close proximity
to that of her companion, which the intruder saw
to be clothed with a thatch of sleek black hair,
and which he recognized as appertaining to a
young man whose father had once been shift
boss on the Rey del Monte, and who bore the
patronymic of Duffy.</p>

<p>Cornelia and Jack Duffy had the appearance
of being completely engrossed in each other&#8217;s
society. In his moment of unobserved survey,
Cannon had time to note the young woman&#8217;s
air of bashful, pleased embarrassment and the
gentleman&#8217;s expression of that tense, unsmiling
earnestness which attends the delivery of sentimental
passages. Cornelia was looking down,
and her flaming hair and the rosy tones of her
face, shading from the faintest of pearly pinks to
deepening degrees of coral, were luminously vivid
against the flat surface of cream-colored wall
behind her, and beside the black poll and thin,
dark cheek of her companion. That something
very tender was afoot was quickly seen by the
visitor, who softly withdrew, stepping gingerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
over the fur rugs, and gaining the entrance to
the hall with a sensation of flurried alarm.</p>

<p>An open door just opposite offered a refuge,
and, passing through it with a forward questing
glance alert for other occupants who might
resent intrusion, the old man entered a small
reception-room lit by the glow of a hard coal
fire. The room was different in furnishings and
style from those he had left. It had the austere
bleakness of aspect resultant from a combination
of bare white walls and large pieces of furniture
of a black wood upon which gold lines were
traced in ornamental squares. An old-fashioned
carpet was on the floor, and several tufted arm-chairs,
begirt with dangling fringes, were drawn
up sociably before the fire. This burned cheerily,
a red focus of heat barred by the stripes of a
grate, and surmounted by a chastely severe white
marble mantelpiece. He had been in the room
often before and knew it for Mrs. Ryan&#8217;s own
particular sanctum. When a celebrated decorator
had been sent out from New York to furnish
the lower floor of the house, she had insisted on
retaining in this apartment the pieces of furniture
and the works of art which she approved, and
which the decorator wished to banish to the
garret. Mrs. Ryan had her way as she always did,
and the first fine &#8220;soote&#8221; of furniture which she
and Con had bought in the days of their early
affluence, and various oil paintings also collected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
in the same era of their evolution, went to the
decking of the room she used for her own and
oftenest sat in.</p>

<p>Cannon approached the fire, and stood there
looking up at the life-size portrait in oils of the
late Cornelius Ryan, which hung over the
chimneypiece. The artist had portrayed him
as a thickly-whiskered man with the complexion
of a healthy infant and eyes of baby blue. A
watch chain, given him by his colleagues in the
old days at Shasta, and formed of squares of
quartz set in native gold, was painted with a
finished carefulness which had pleased Mrs. Ryan
even more than the likeness had done. In showing
the picture, she was wont to say proudly,
&#8220;Just look at the watch chain! Seems as if
you could almost hear the ticking of the watch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cannon was speculating as to the merits of
the likeness when he heard the silken rustling of
skirts, and turned to greet his old friend. She
came in smiling, with extended hand, richly clad,
the gleam of a fastening jewel at her neck. Her
hair was dressed with a shining, smooth elaboration,
drawn up tightly at the sides and arranged
over her forehead in careful curls. As she and
her visitor exchanged the first sentences of greeting
he noticed that she looked much older and
more worn than she had done the last time he
had seen her, but her face was as full of pugnacious
force as ever. While Delia Ryan&#8217;s body lived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
her spirit would hold its dominion. She had
ruled all her life and would do so to the end.</p>

<p>They sat down on either side of the fire and the
old man said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether I ought to be in here.
The Chinaman left me to my fate, and I had to
nose about myself and find out where I belonged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s Lee,&#8221; she answered with a short
laugh. &#8220;He waits on the door every other
Sunday. We&#8217;ve had him ten years and no one&#8217;s
ever been able to make him show people into the
parlor. He thinks it better to leave them standing
in the hall till one of us sees the card. Then
he&#8217;ll go down and tell them as sociably as you
please &#8216;to go right in and sit down.&#8217; I asked him
why he didn&#8217;t do it at first, and he said &#8216;they
might steal something.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Cannon looked into the fire with an amused eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he thought I was after the spoons.
It&#8217;s a dangerous habit, for I took the first turning
to the right and butted into Cornelia and a young
man who gave me to understand I&#8217;d come the
wrong way around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did they say?&#8221; said the mother,
her face stiffening with sudden disapproving
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t say anything. That was just
it. They didn&#8217;t even see me. But they certainly
led me to believe that I&#8217;d got somewhere
where I wasn&#8217;t wanted. I may not be smart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
but a hint doesn&#8217;t have to be much harder than
the kick of a mule for me to see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ryan looked at him consideringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, nodding, &#8220;it&#8217;s a case, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It ought to be satisfactory,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;Pat Duffy, the father of those boys, was one of
the finest fellers I ever knew. He was shift boss on
the Rey del Monte in seventy-one when I was the
superintendent. He got out of Virginia with his
pile, didn&#8217;t lose it like the others. He had an
easy three million when he came down here
and bought the Bristed house on Pine Street.
And Jack&#8217;s the best of his children. Maggie,
who married the English baronet, was a nice
sort of girl, but she&#8217;s never come back, and Terry&#8217;s
smart enough, but not the kind you can bank on.
Jack&#8217;s a good, straight boy. Cornelia couldn&#8217;t
do better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I think,&#8221; said the mother, who,
however, looked grave and worried. &#8220;Cornelia&#8217;s
thirty. It&#8217;s time for her to settle, and she&#8217;ll make
a good wife. They&#8217;ll live here, too. There&#8217;ll be
no kicking up of their heels and going off to Europe
or New York and thinking themselves too good
to come back to California, like Maggie Duffy and
her baronet. I want them here. I want to see
some grandchildren round this house before I die.
I want to know where Con&#8217;s money is going to.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed, and it was obvious that her heart
was heavy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it&#8217;s a good marriage and I&#8217;m
pleased at it. Jack&#8217;s a Roman Catholic but you
can&#8217;t have everything down here in this world.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Ryans were Protestants, almost the only
prominent Irish-American family in San Francisco
which belonged to that church. Cornelius Ryan
had been a North-country man, and went out
with the Orange men when they paraded. He
had been firm in his faith and so had his wife,
and with the Hibernian&#8217;s violent devotion to
creed they had made public their antipathy to
the Church of Rome and their hopes that their
children would not make alliances with its
members.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh well,&#8221; said Cannon with a shrug of vague
tolerance, &#8220;a man&#8217;s beliefs don&#8217;t matter. With
a woman it&#8217;s a different thing. She brings up the
children and takes her religion hard. Jack won&#8217;t
interfere with Cornelia that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; said the mother. There was
a slight pause and then she said with a sigh,</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, thank God, one of my children&#8217;s going
to marry as I want.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was gazing into the fire and did not notice
the quick look, sly and piercing, that her companion
shot at her. The conversation had suddenly,
without any effort of his, fallen upon the
subject to which he had intended directing it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, looking away from her, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
had one disappointment. That&#8217;s enough.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>&#8220;Disappointment!&#8221; she echoed in a loud voice.
&#8220;Disappointment? I&#8217;ve lost my son; lost him
as if he was dead&mdash;worse than if he was dead,
for then I&#8217;d know he was happy and safe somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a cry of pain, Rachel mourning for her
child. The note of feeling in it checked the
remark on Cannon&#8217;s lips. He understood what
her suffering was and respected it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Bill Cannon,&#8221; she went on, turning the
perturbed fierceness of her face on him, &#8220;how
often do you think I see my boy? What ties
do you think he has with his home? He came
up here after he&#8217;d got back from Antelope, but
before that I&#8217;d only seen him once in six weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s pretty hard,&#8221; he commented, his elbow
on the arm of the chair, his chin sunk in the cup
of his up-curled hand. &#8220;That&#8217;s pretty tough.
I didn&#8217;t know it was as bad as that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody knows anything about him. He
won&#8217;t let them. He won&#8217;t let me. He&#8217;s proud,
and trying to hide it all. That&#8217;s the reason he
comes up here so seldom. He knows I can see
into him, see through him, clear through him,
and he don&#8217;t want me to see how miserable he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said the old man, moving slightly and
raising his eyes to look at her. The interjection
was full of significance, pregnant with understanding,
appreciation and enlightenment. He was
surprised himself. He had thought, and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
understood from Dominick, that no one, especially
no one of his own people, knew of the young man&#8217;s
domestic infelicities. Neither of them was shrewd
enough to realize that the mother would guess,
would know by instinct.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what do you suppose he came up for
that once?&#8221; pursued Mrs. Ryan. &#8220;You could
guess a lot of times but you&#8217;d never strike it.
He came up here the night of my ball to ask me
to give him an invitation for his wife!&#8221;</p>

<p>She stared at her visitor with her face set in a
stony hardness, a hardness reminiscent of that
which had marked it when Dominick had asked
for the invitation. Cannon saw it and checked
the remark that rose to his lips. He was going
to say &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you give it to him?&#8221; and
he saw that it was too light a comment for what
had been a tragic occasion. All he did was to
utter a grunt that might have meant anything
and was consequently safe.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what his marriage has done for him,
and that&#8217;s the state that woman has ground him
down to. She&#8217;d worked on him till she&#8217;d got him
to come up here and ask for it a few minutes
before the people began to arrive! That&#8217;s what
she made him do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you wouldn&#8217;t give it?&#8221; he inquired
mildly, inwardly surprised, as he had been often
before, at the rancor displayed by women in their
quarrels.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>&#8220;Give it?&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;well, I guess not.
It would have been my surrender. I&#8217;d have
thrown up the fight for ever when I did that.&#8221;
And then as if she had read his thoughts: &#8220;It&#8217;s
not natural meanness either. There&#8217;s only one
hope for me&mdash;for me and for Dominick, too.
Divorce.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not move his chin from its resting-place
in his up-curled hand, but made a slight assenting
motion with his head, and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s the only thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s been my hope since the day when I
first saw her. I didn&#8217;t know then she&#8217;d been
anything to Dominick before the marriage, but
I knew the first look I had at her what she was.
That long, mean nose and those sly eyes, and
seven years older than the boy if she was a day.
You didn&#8217;t have to tell me any more. I saw
then just like a flash in the dark what my son had
let himself in for. And then, not a month after,
I heard the rest about her, and I knew that
Dominick had started in to ruin his life about
the best way he knew how.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cannon gave another grunt, and this time it
contained a recognizable note of sympathy.
She went on, absorbed in her recital, anxious to
pour out her griefs, now that she had begun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right there from the start I thought of
divorce. I knew it was the only way out and
was bound to come in time. The woman had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
married Dominick for money and position. I
knew that, saw it in her face along with other
things. There was no love in that face, just
calculation, hard and sharp as a meat ax. I
shut down on the money right there and then.
Dominick had three thousand a year, so I knew
he couldn&#8217;t starve, but three thousand a year
wasn&#8217;t what she&#8217;d married him for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got along on it for over two years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. She&#8217;s beaten me so far. I&#8217;m the
keeper of Con Ryan&#8217;s fortune and I just closed
my hand on it and said to her in so many words,
&#8216;Not a cent of this for you.&#8217; I thought she&#8217;d
tire of struggling along in a flat with one Chinaman
and not a soul to come near her. But she&#8217;s
stood it and she&#8217;s going to go on standing it.
Where she&#8217;s concerned, I did something the
smartest men and women sometimes do&mdash;underrated
the brains of my enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s pretty smart, I guess,&#8221; said Cannon,
raising a gravely-commenting eye to his companion&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what she is,&mdash;smart and long-headed.
She&#8217;s more far-sighted than women of her kind
usually are and she&#8217;s got her eye on the future.
She&#8217;s not going to give us a chance for divorce.
She&#8217;s not going to make any breaks or mistakes.
There&#8217;s not a more respectable woman in San
Francisco. She doesn&#8217;t go with any one but her
husband and her own sisters, two decent women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
that you can&#8217;t believe have the same blood in
them. She&#8217;s the quietest, most domestic kind of
a wife. It don&#8217;t matter, and nobody knows, that
she&#8217;s making her husband the most miserable man
in the country. That doesn&#8217;t cut any ice. What
does is that there&#8217;s no ground for divorce against
her. If she had the kind of husband that wouldn&#8217;t
put up with anything from a woman, all he could
do would be to leave her and she&#8217;d go round
then getting everybody&#8217;s sympathies as a virtuous,
deserted wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man gave his head an appreciative
jerk, and murmured,</p>

<p>&#8220;A pretty smart woman, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s all that&mdash;that and more. It&#8217;s the
future that she&#8217;s banking on. I&#8217;m nearly seventy
years of age, Bill Cannon, and this has broken
me up more than anything that&#8217;s gone before.
I&#8217;m not the woman I was before my boy married.
And what&#8217;s going to happen when I die? I&#8217;ve
only got two living children. Outside them there&#8217;s
nobody but some distant relations that Con made
settlements on before he died. If I left all I&#8217;ve
got to Cornelia, or divided it up between Cornelia
and charity, cutting off my son because he&#8217;d
made a marriage I didn&#8217;t like, would such a
will as that stand? Why had I left nothing to
my only son? Because he&#8217;d married a woman
I didn&#8217;t think good enough? And what was there
against her? She&#8217;d been a typewriter and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
husband&#8217;s mistress for six months before he
married her. The mistress part of it had been
condoned by marriage and good conduct&mdash;and
after all, how many families in San Francisco
and other places were founded on just those
beginnings? As for her being a typewriter, Delia
Ryan herself had been a washerwoman, washed
for the miners with these hands;&#8221;&mdash;she held out
her blunt, beringed hands with one of those
dramatic gestures natural to the Irish&mdash;&#8220;when
Con was working underground with his pick I
was at the wash-tub, and I made money that way
for him to run the mine. Where&#8217;s the California
jury that would hesitate to award Dominick, and
through him, his wife her part of the fortune
that Con and I made?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s all possible,&#8221; Cannon said slowly,
&#8220;but it&#8217;s so far off. It&#8217;s all surmise. You may
live twenty years yet. I fancy she&#8217;d find a
twenty-years&#8217; wait under the present conditions
rather wearying.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman shook her head, looking very
sad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not the woman I was,&#8221; she repeated,
&#8220;this last thing&#8217;s broken me more than anything
that went before. I lost three children by death,
and it wasn&#8217;t as hard as losing my youngest boy
the way I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any idea whether Dominick has
ever thought of divorce?&#8221; he asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve the clearest kind of an idea that he
hasn&#8217;t. You don&#8217;t know Dominick. He&#8217;s the
best boy in the world. He&#8217;ll blame himself for
everything that&#8217;s gone wrong, not that woman.
She&#8217;s smart enough to let him, too. And suppose
he was a different kind and did think of it? That&#8217;s
all the good it would do him. Men don&#8217;t sue
women for divorce except under the greatest
provocation, and Dominick&#8217;s got no provocation
at all. My hopes were that the woman herself
would sue&mdash;that we&#8217;d freeze her out with small
means and cold shoulders&mdash;and you see that&#8217;s
just what she&#8217;s determined not to do!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cannon dropped his supporting hand on the
chair-arm and began to caress gently a large
tassel that hung there.</p>

<p>&#8220;She could be approached in another way,&#8221;
he said with a suggestion of pondering deliberation.</p>

<p>&#8220;What way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say she married Dominick for money.
Have you never thought of buying her off?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at Mrs. Ryan and met her eyes
staring anxiously and, in a sort of way, shyly
into his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said in a low voice, &#8220;I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you tried it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t think I dared,&#8221; she said
almost desperately. &#8220;It was my last trump.&#8221;</p>

<p>He realized, and, though he was unmoved by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
it, felt the pathos of this admission from the proud
and combative woman who had so long and so
successfully domineered over her world.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it <i>is</i> a sort of death-bed remedy,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;but it seems to me it&#8217;s about time to
try it. Your idea that she&#8217;s going to wait till
you die and then claim part of the estate as
Dominick&#8217;s wife is all very well, but she&#8217;s not the
kind of woman to be willing to wait patiently
through the rolling years on three thousand
dollars per annum. She&#8217;s a good bit older than
he is and it isn&#8217;t making her any happier to see
her best days passing with nothing doing. I
should think you stood a pretty good chance of
getting her to listen to reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Offering her a sum down to leave him?&#8221; she
said, looking at the fire, her brows knit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. Offer her a good sum on the stipulation
that she leaves him and goes away to
New York or Europe. Then in the course of
time she can write him asking him to grant her a
divorce on some such technical grounds as desertion,
or incompatibility, or anything else that&#8217;s
respectable. He&#8217;ll have to give it to her. He
can&#8217;t do anything else. And there you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What if she refuses?&#8221; she said in a low voice,
and he saw she was afraid of this refusal which
would shatter her last hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Raise your offer,&#8221; he answered briskly. &#8220;She
probably will refuse the first time.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>She pondered, eying the fire with heavy
immobility.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, nodding. &#8220;It sounds reasonable.
It&#8217;s about the only thing left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can be of any assistance to you,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;you just call on me. I&#8217;m willing to help in
this thing all I can. It goes against me to see
Dominick caught in a trap this way just at the
beginning of his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A boy,&#8221; said his mother, &#8220;that would have
made some good girl so happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cannon rose from his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it!&#8221; he said, &#8220;and there are not
so many of &#8217;em round that we can afford to lose
one of the best. I&#8217;ve always liked Dominick and
getting to know him so well up at Antelope I
grew downright fond of him. He&#8217;s a fine boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled at her with his most genial air,
beaming with disinterested affection for Dominick
and the desire to be helpful in a grievous
strait. Mrs. Ryan looked brighter and more
hopeful than she had done at the beginning of
the interview.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very good of you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;to come
and listen to an old woman&#8217;s complaints. But
as we get on, we seem to take them harder. And
you know what my boy was to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About the same thing that my girl is to me,&#8221;
Cannon answered as he turned away to look on
the table for his hat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>There was a little more talk, and then the set
phrases of farewell brought the interview to a
close. Though momentous, it had not lasted
long. As he left the room, Cannon heard the
single note of half-past three chime from the clock
on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>Outside he stood for a moment on the top of
the marble steps, looking downward with absent
eyes. He was completely engrossed with the
just-ended conversation, parts of which repeated
themselves in his mind as he stared unseeingly
down the wide, unencumbered vista of the street.</p>

<p>Carriages flashed past through strips of sunshine;
automobiles whirred by, leaving dust and
gasoline in their wake. On the sidewalks there
were many foot passengers: lazily sauntering
couples, lovers, family parties, and little groups
bound for the cars which would whisk them over
the dunes to the park. As he slowly began to
descend, one of these groups, formed of three
women, a man, and a child, approached the bottom
of the steps. They were walking down the
avenue in a close, talkative bunch. The descending
magnate was apprised of their proximity by
the high, cackling sound of the women&#8217;s voices
and an aura of perfume which extended from
them into the surrounding ether. He paid no
attention to them, his eye, with its look of inward
brooding, passing indifferently over the faces
turned eagerly toward him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>They were not so unmoved. Their glances were
trained full on him, their eyes wide in the unblinking
intensity of their scrutiny. Even the child,
who was skipping along beside the eldest of the
women, inspected him with solemn care. Brushing
by in their gay Sunday raiment they drew
together to discuss him, their heads in a cluster,
their voices lowered. He was so used to being
the object of such interest that he did not bother
to look at them, and was therefore unaware that
one of the women, quite pretty, with reddish
hair and dark eyes, had turned as she moved
away and surveyed him over her shoulder.</p>

<small>BERNY MAKES A DISCOVERY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was near eleven o&#8217;clock on that same Sunday
morning, when Berny, wrappered and heavy-eyed,
emerged from her room. She shuffled
down the passage to the dining-room, sending her
voice before her in a shrill summons to the Chinaman.
The morning papers were scattered over
the table as Dominick had left them and she
gathered them up, sitting sidewise in her chair
and running her eye down their columns, while
the servant set out her breakfast. She was still
sleepy, and frequent yawns interrupted her perusal
of the lines of print which interested her above
all written matter. A kimono clothed her slim
form and from beneath its hem her foot protruded,
thrust bare into a furred slipper. She folded the
paper over to bring the society column into a
prominence easy of access, and, propping it up
against a bowl of fruit, read as she ate her
breakfast.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the meal she inquired of
the servant at what time her husband had gone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
out, and received the reply that Mr. Ryan had
had his breakfast and left the flat two hours
earlier. There was nothing disconcerting or
unusual about this, as Dominick always went for
a walk on fine Sunday mornings, but her mind
was far from easy and she immediately fell to
wondering why he had departed so early, and the
slight ferment of disquietude that was always
with her stirred again and made her forget the
society column and let her Spanish omelet grow
cold.</p>

<p>There was something strange about Dominick
since he had come back, something that intrigued
her, that she could not satisfactorily explain.
She assured herself that he was still angry, but
in the deeper places of her understanding the
voice that whispers the truth and will not be
gainsaid told her it was not that. Neither was
it exactly antagonism. In a way he had been
studiously kind and polite to her, a sort of consciously-guarded
politeness, such as one might
practise to a guest with whom one was intimate
without being friendly. She tried to explain to
herself just what this change was, and when it
came to putting the matter in words she could not
find the right ones. It was a coldness, a coldness
that was not harsh and did not express itself in
actions or phrases. It went deeper; it was
exhaled from the inner places of his being.</p>

<p>Sometimes as she talked to him she would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
meet his eyes fixed on her with a deep, vacant
glance, which she suddenly realized was unseeing
and unheeding. In the evening as he sat reading
in the cramped confines of the den she surreptitiously
watched him and saw that a moment
often came when he dropped his book, and with
his long body limp in the arm-chair, his chin
sunk on his breast, would sit with a brooding gaze
fixed on nothing. Once, as he was dreaming this
way, she said suddenly,</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you thinking of, Dominick?
Antelope?&#8221;</p>

<p>He started and turned upon her a face that
had reddened consciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I think of Antelope?&#8221; he said,
and she was aware that her remark had startled
him and made him uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;For no particular reason,&#8221; she answered
lightly; &#8220;you just looked as if you were thinking
of something a long way off.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tried to reassure herself that it all rose
from the quarrel. To believe that comforted her
and gave her confidence, but it was hard to think
it, for not only did her own instinct proclaim
against it, but Dominick&#8217;s manner and attitude
were in distinct refutation of any such theory.
He was not sullen, he was absent; he was not
resentful, he was indifferent. And in small
outward ways he tried to please her, which was
not after the manner of a sore and angry man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
On this very Sunday he had agreed to meet her
and her family in the park at the band stand at
four. She always dined with her sisters on Sunday
and if the weather was fine they went to the
park and listened to the music. It was nearly
a year now since Dominick had joined these
family parties, preferring to walk on the Presidio
hills and the Cliff House beach with a friend from
the bank. But on the evening before he had
promised to meet them; been quite agreeable
about it, Berny had thought, when her pleadings
and importunities had finally extorted from him
a promise to join them there.</p>

<p>She left the dining-room and walked up the
hallway to the parlor, her head drooped, anxieties
gnawing at her. The little room was flooded
with sunshine, and she parted the lace curtains
and, throwing up the window, leaned out. The
rich, enveloping warmth surrounded her, clasped
her, seemed to sink deep into her and thaw the
apprehensions that were so cold at her heart.
She drew in the sweet, still air, that did not
stimulate but that had in it something of a
crystalline youth and freshness, like the air of
an untainted world, concerned with nothing but
the joy of living. The scents of flowers were
in it; the mellowness of the earth and its fruits.
Peace was the message of this tranquil Sunday
morning, peace was in the sunshine, in the sound
of bells with which the air was full, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
fall of feet&mdash;light, joyous feet&mdash;on the pavement,
in the voices of passers-by and the laughter,
sweet and broken, of children. It was not right
for any one to harbor cankering cares on such a
day. The earth was happy, abandoned to the
sunshine, irresponsible, care free, rejoicing in the
perfect moment. The woman felt the restoring
processes that Nature, in its tireless generosity,
offers to all who will take them. She felt eased
of her troubles, soothed and cheered, as though
the enwrapping radiance that bathed her held
an opiate for jangled nerves. Blinking in the
brightness she leaned on the window-sill, immovable,
quieted, feeling the warmth suffuse her and
dissipate those alarms that half an hour earlier
had been so chill and heavy.</p>

<p>As she dressed, the sense of well-being and
confidence increased. She looked very well this
morning. Since Dominick&#8217;s return she had looked
haggard and thin. Sometimes she had seemed
to see, showing shadowy through her reflected
face in the mirror, the lines and hollows of that
face when time should have put a stamp on it
that neither massage nor pigments would efface.
A sudden moment of revelation showed her herself
as an old woman, her nose pointed, her mouth
a thin, tight line. This morning the glass gave her
back none of these disconcerting hints. She was
at her best, and as she dressed carefully and
slowly, she had the satisfaction of seeing that each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
added article of apparel increased her good looks.
When she finally put on her new hat&mdash;the one
she had bought in celebration of Dominick&#8217;s
return&mdash;and over it tied a white and black dotted
veil, she was so gratified with the picture she
presented that she was reluctant to leave it and
pirouetted slowly before the glass, surveying her
back and side views, and finally lifting her skirt
that she might see the full effect of her lilac
petticoat as it burst into sight in an ebullition of
pleats and frills.</p>

<p>Walking up the avenue she was bridlingly
conscious that her brilliant appearance drew its
tribute of glances. Many people looked at her,
and their sidelong admiration was an even more
exhilarating tonic than the sunshine. She walked
with a light, elastic step, spreading perfume on
the air, her progress accompanied by a rich,
seductive rustle. Once or twice she passed members
of that exclusive world from which she had
stolen Dominick. She swept by them, languidly
indifferent, her eyes looking with glacial hauteur
over their heads. The sound made by her brushing
silk petticoats was gratifyingly aggressive.
She imparted to them a slight disdainful swing,
and lifted her dress skirt daintily higher, conscious
of the impeccable amplitude of her emerging lilac
frills.</p>

<p>The habit of dining with her own people on
Sunday had been one she had never abandoned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
even in the first aspiring days of her marriage.
It was a sort of family reunion and at first
Dominick had been a not unwilling participant
in its domestic festivities. The solid bourgeois
respectability of his wife&#8217;s relations appealed to
him. For all his advantages in money and
education he was of the same class himself, and
while Berny was, if not a beloved spouse, a yet
endurable one, he had found the Sunday gatherings
and subsequent hejira to the park not
entirely objectionable. For over a year now he
had escaped from it, pleading the need of open
air and exercise, and his sisters-in-law, who had at
first protested, had grown used to his absence
and accepted it as something to bear uncomplainingly.</p>

<p>The day was so fine that they hurried through
their dinner, a hearty and lavish meal, the <i>chef-d&#8217;&#339;uvre</i>
of Hannah&#8217;s housekeeping, and, loath
to lose a moment of the sunshine, determined to
walk down to Van Ness Avenue and there catch
an outgoing car to the park. It was the middle
of the afternoon and the great thoroughfare lay
still and idle in the slanting light. There was
something foreign, almost tropical in its vista,
in the scene that hung like a drop curtain at
the limit of sight&mdash;pale blue hills dotted with
ochre-colored houses&mdash;in the background of sky
deep in tint, the foliage dark against it as if
printed upon its intense glaring blue, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
sharp lines of palms and spiky leaves crossing
stuccoed walls. The people that moved slowly
along the sidewalks fitted into this high-colored
exotic setting. There was no hurry or crowding
among them. They progressed with an un-American
deliberation, tasting the delicate sweetness
of the air, rejoicing in the sky and the sun, pausing
to look at the dark bushiness of a drac&aelig;na against
a wash of blue, the skeleton blossom of a Century
plant, the pool of thick scarlet made by a parterre
of geranium.</p>

<p>The three sisters&mdash;Hannah and Pearl leading,
Berny and Hazel walking behind with Josh&mdash;fared
buoyantly down the street. As they passed,
they commented on the houses and their inmates.
They had plenty of stories of the dwellers in those
solemn palaces, many of whom were people whose
humble beginnings they knew by heart, and
whose rapid rise had been watched almost awe-stricken
by an admiring and envious community.</p>

<p>As the Ryan house loomed into view their
chatter ceased and their eyes, serious with staring
attention, were fixed on the mansion which had
so stubbornly closed its doors on one of them.
Sensations of varying degrees of animosity stirred
in each of them, except the child, still too young
to be tainted by the corroding sense of worldly
injustice. She skipped along sidewise, her warm,
soft hand clasped in her Aunt Hannah&#8217;s decently-gloved
palm. Some wave or vibration of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
intense feelings of her elders passed to her, and
as they drew nearer the house she, too, began to
grow grave, and her skipping quieted down into
a sober walk.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Uncle Dominick&#8217;s house, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
she said to Hannah.</p>

<p>Hannah nodded. By far the most amiable and
wide-minded of the sisters, she could not rise
above the sense of rankling indignation that she
felt against the Ryans for their treatment of
Berny.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the biggest house in San Francisco,&#8221;
said Pearl over her shoulder to her parents.
&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it, Popper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it is,&#8221; answered Josh, giving his head
a confirmatory wag, &#8220;and even if it ain&#8217;t, it&#8217;s
big enough, the Lord knows!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see what a private family wants
with all that room,&#8221; said Hannah with a condemnatory
air. &#8220;There must be whole sootes of
rooms on that upper floor that nobody lives in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you fret. They&#8217;re all occupied,&#8221; said
Berny. &#8220;Each one of them has their own
particular soote. Cornie has three rooms all of
her own, and even the housekeeper has a private
bath!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And there&#8217;s twelve indoor servants,&#8221; said
Hazel. &#8220;They want a lot of space for them.
Twelve servants, just think of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twelve servants!&#8221; ejaculated Hannah almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
with a groan. &#8220;Well, that don&#8217;t seem to me
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were close to the house now and silence
fell on them, as though the antagonism of its
owners was exhaled upon them from the mansion&#8217;s
aggressive bulk, like an unspoken curse. They
felt overawed, and at the same time proud that
one of their number should have even the most
distant affiliations with a family too exclusive to
know her. The women with their more responsive
and sensitive natures felt it more delicately than
Josh, who blunderingly expressed one of the
thoughts of the moment by remarking,</p>

<p>&#8220;Some day you&#8217;ll live in there, Berny, and boss
the twelve servants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rats!&#8221; said Berny, giving her head an angry
toss. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather live in my flat and boss Sing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josh&#8217;s whistle of facetious incredulity died away
incomplete, for at that moment the hall door
opened and a portly masculine shape emerged
upon the porch. Berny, at the first glance, was
not sure of its identity, but her doubts were
dispelled by her brother-in-law&#8217;s quick sentence,
delivered on the rise of a surprised breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill Cannon, by gum! What&#8217;s he doing
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>This name, as powerful to conjure with in the
city as in the mining-camps, cast its instantaneous
spell upon the sisters, who stared avid-eyed upon
the great man. He for his part seemed oblivious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
to their glances and to their presence. He stood
on the top step for a musing moment, looking
down with that sort of filmy fixity of gaze which
is noticeable in the glance of the resting eagle.
His appearance was a last crowning touch to
the proud, unapproachable distinction of the
Ryans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t he look as if he was thinking?&#8221; said
Hazel in a whisper. &#8220;I wonder what&#8217;s on his
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably that Monday&#8217;s pay-day and he don&#8217;t
know whether he can scratch through,&#8221; said the
jocose Josh.</p>

<p>Berny did not say anything. She felt the
interest in Cannon that she did in all conquering,
successful people, and in her heart it gave her
a sense of added importance to think that the
family she had married into and who refused to
know her was on friendly terms with the Bonanza
King.</p>

<p>A half-hour later they had found seats in front
of the band stand in the park, and, settling themselves
with a great rustling and preening of
plumage, prepared to enjoy the music. Hannah
and Pearl were given two chairs at the end of a
row, and Hazel and Berny, with Josh as escort,
secured four on the line immediately behind.
Dominick had not yet appeared, so the sisters
spread their skirts over a vacant seat between
them, and Berny, in the intervals of inspecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
the people around her, sent exploring glances
about for the tall figure of her husband.</p>

<p>She was very fond of the park and band
stand on such Sunday afternoons. To go there
had been one of the great diversions of her girlhood.
She loved to look at this holiday gathering
of all types, among which her own class was
largely represented. The outdoor amphitheater
of filled benches was to her what the ball-room
and the glittering horseshoe at the opera are to
the woman of society. She saw many old friends
among the throng, girls who had been contemporaries
of hers when she had first &#8220;gone to work,&#8221;
and had long since married in their own world
and now dragged children by the hand. She
looked them over with an almost passionate curiosity,
discomfited to see the fresh youth of some, and
pleased to note that others looked weighed down
with maternal cares. Berny regarded women who
had children as fools, and the children grouped
about these mothers of her own age&mdash;three and
four sometimes, with the husband carrying a
baby&mdash;were to her only annoying, burdensome
creatures that made the party seem a little ridiculous,
and had not half the impressiveness or style
of her elegant costume and lilac frills.</p>

<p>The magnificent afternoon had brought out a
throng of people. Every seat in the lines of
benches was full and foot passengers kept constantly
coming up, standing for a few measures,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
and then moving on. They were of all kinds.
The beauty of the day had even tempted the
more fashionable element out, and the two sisters
saw many elegantly-dressed ladies of the sort
on whom Hazel fitted hats all day, and that
evoked in Berny a deep and respectful curiosity.
Both women, sitting high in their chairs, craned
their necks this way and that, spying through
breaks in the crowd, and following attractive
figures with dodging movements of their heads.
When either one saw anything she liked or thought
interesting she laid a hand on the other&#8217;s knee,
giving it a slight dig, and designated the object
of her attention in a few broken words, detached
and disconnected like notes for a sentence.</p>

<p>They were thus engaged when Hazel saw
Dominick and, rising, hailed him with a beckoning
hand. He made his way toward them, moving
deliberately, once or twice pausing to greet
acquaintances. He was taller than any man
in the surrounding throng and Berny, watching
him, felt a sense of proprietary pride swelling in
her when she noted his superiority. The son of
an Irish laborer and a girl who had begun life
as the general servant in a miner&#8217;s boarding-house,
he looked as if his forebears might have
been the flower of the nation. He wore a loose-fitting
suit of gray tweed, a wide, gray felt sombrero,
and round his waist a belt of yellow leather.
His collar turning back from his neck exposed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
brown strength of his throat, and on lifting his
hat in a passing salutation, his head with its
cropped curly hair, the ears growing close against
it, showed golden brown in the sunlight.</p>

<p>With a phrase of greeting he joined them, and
then as they swept their skirts off the chair they
had been hiding, slipped in front of Berny and
sat down. Hazel began to talk to him. Her
conversation was of a rallying, joking sort, at
which she was quite proficient. Berny heard him
laugh and knew by the tone of his voice that
he was pretending and was not really amused.
She had nothing particular to say to him, feeling
that she had accomplished enough in inducing
him to join them, and, sitting forward on the
edge of her chair, continued to watch the people.
A blonde coiffure some rows in front caught her
eye and she was studying its intricacies through
the interstices that came and went between the
moving heads, when the sudden emergence into
view of an unusually striking female figure diverted
her attention. The woman had come up from
behind and, temporarily stopped by the crowd,
had come to a standstill a few rows in front of
where the sisters sat. She was accompanied by
a young man dressed in the Sunday dignity of
frock-coat and silk hat. As he turned to survey
the lines of filled chairs, Berny saw that he had a
pale skin, a small black mustache, and dark eyes.</p>

<p>But her interest in him was of the slightest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
Her attention was immediately riveted upon the
woman, who became the object of a glance
which inspected her with a piercing eagerness
from her hat to the hem of her shirt. Berny
could not see her face, but her habiliments were
of the latest mode and of an unusual and subdued
elegance which bespoke an origin in a more
sophisticated center than San Francisco. Berny,
all agog with curiosity, stared at the lady&#8217;s back,
noting not only her clothes but a certain carelessness
in the way they were put on. Her hat
was not quite straight. The comb, which crossed
the back of her head and kept her hair smooth,
was crooked, and blonde wisps hung from it
over her collar. The hand that held up her
skirt in a loose perfunctory manner, as though
these rich encasings were possessions of no moment,
was covered by a not particularly clean white
glove.</p>

<p>Such unconsciousness added the distinction of
indifference to the already marked figure. Berny
wondered more than ever who it was and longed
to see the averted face. She was about to lean
across Dominick and attract Hazel&#8217;s attention by
a poking finger directed against her knee, when
the woman, with a word to her companion, moved
her head and let a slow glance sweep over the
rows of faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hazel,&#8221; Berny hissed across Dominick, &#8220;look
at that girl. Who is she?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>She did not divert her eyes from the woman&#8217;s
face, which she now saw in profile. It was pretty,
she thought, more from a rich, unmingled purity
of coloring than from any particular beauty of
feature. The head with its gravely-traveling
glance continued to turn till Berny had the
satisfaction of seeing the face in three-quarters.
A moment later the moving eyes lighted indifferently
on Hazel, then ceased to progress, suddenly,
bruskly, as though checked by the
imperative stoppage of regulating machinery.</p>

<p>Only a person watching closely would have
noticed it, but Berny was watching with the most
vigilant closeness. She saw the infusion of a new
and keener interest transform the glance, concentrate
its lazy, diffused attention into something
that had the sharpness and suddenness of a
leaping flame. The next moment a flood of color
rose clearly pink over the face, and then, most
surprising of all, the lady bent her head in a
grave, deliberate bow.</p>

<p>Berny turned, startled&mdash;and in a vague, undefined
way, disturbed, too&mdash;to see who had been
the object of this salutation. To her astonishment
it was Dominick. As she looked at him,
he replaced his hat and she saw&mdash;to the augmentation
of that vague sense of disturbance&mdash;that
he was as pale as the bowing woman was pink.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dominick,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;who&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Cannon,&#8221; he said in a low tone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>&#8220;Rose Cannon?&#8221; hissed Hazel on the other
side of him, her face thrust forward, and tense
in the interest of the moment, &#8220;Bill Cannon&#8217;s
daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I met her at Antelope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Berny, did you see her dress?&#8221; Hazel hung
over her brother-in-law in her excitement.
&#8220;That&#8217;s straight from Paris, I&#8217;ll bet you a
dollar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw it,&#8221; said Berny in a voice that
did not sound particularly exhilarated; &#8220;maybe
it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked back at Miss Cannon who had
turned away and was moving off through the
crowd with her escort. Then she leaned toward
Dominick. His voice had not sounded natural;
as she placed her arm against his she could feel
that he trembled.</p>

<p>She said nothing but settled back in her chair,
dryly swallowing. In those few past moments
her whole world had undergone a revolution
that left her feeling dazed and a little sick. It
was as if the earth had suddenly whirled around
and she had come up panting and clutching
among familiar things reversed and upset. In
an instantaneous flash of illumination she saw
everything&mdash;the look in the woman&#8217;s eyes, her
rush of color, Dominick&#8217;s voice, his expression,
the trembling of his arm&mdash;it was all perfectly
plain! This was the girl he had been shut in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
Antelope with for three weeks. Now she knew
what the change was, the inexplicable, mysterious
change that had so puzzled her.</p>

<p>She felt bewildered, and under her bewilderment
a pain, a fierce, unfamiliar pain, gripped her.
She did not for the moment say anything or
want to speak, and she felt as a child does who is
dazed and stupefied by an unexpected assault of
ill treatment. The slight sensation of inward
sinking, that made her feel a little sick, continued
and she sat in a chilled and drooping silence, all
her bridling conceit in herself and her fine clothes
stricken suddenly out of her.</p>

<p>She heard Hazel asking Dominick questions
about Miss Cannon, and she heard Dominick&#8217;s
answers, brief and given with a reticent doggedness.
Then Hazel asked him for the time and
she was conscious of his elbow pressing against
her arm as he felt for his watch. As he drew it
out and held it toward the questioner, Berny
suddenly leaned forward, and, catching his hand
with the watch in it, turned its face toward her.
The hand beneath hers was cold, and shook.
She let it go and again sank back in her chair.
The feeling of sickness grew stronger and was
augmented by a sense of physical feebleness, of
being tremulous and cold deep down in her bones.</p>

<p>Hazel rose to her feet, shaking her skirts into
place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go on,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it&#8217;s getting chilly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
Come along, Josh. I suppose if you were let
alone, you&#8217;d sit here till sundown listening to the
music in a trance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dominick and Josh rose and there was an
adjusting and putting-on of wraps. Berny still
sat motionless, her hands, stiff in their tight
gloves, lying open on her lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, Berny,&#8221; said Hazel. &#8220;It&#8217;s too
cold to sit here any longer. Why, how funny you
look, all pale and shriveled up! You&#8217;re as bad
as Josh. You and he ought to have married
each other. You&#8217;d have been a prize couple.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josh laughed loudly at this sally, leaning round
the figure of his wife to present his foolish, good-humored
face, creased with a grin, to Berny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you willing, Berny?&#8221; he cried gaily.
&#8220;I can get a divorce whenever you say. It will
be dead easy; brutal and inhuman treatment.
Just say the word!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be brutal and inhuman treatment if
you don&#8217;t move on and stop blocking the way, Josh
McCrae,&#8221; said Hazel severely. &#8220;I want to go
out that side and there you are right in the path,
trying to be funny.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cheerful Josh, still laughing, turned and
moved onward between the seats, the others
following him. The mass of the crowd was not
yet leaving, and as the little group moved forward
in a straggling line toward the drive, the exciting
opening of the <i>William Tell Overture</i> boomed out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
from the sounding board. It was a favorite
piece, and they left lingeringly, Hazel and Josh
particularly fascinated, with heads turned and ears
trained on the band. Josh&#8217;s hand, passed through
his wife&#8217;s arm, affectionately pressed her against
his side, for despite the sharpness of their recriminations
they were the most loving of couples.</p>

<p>Berny was the last of the line. In the flurry
of departure her silence had passed unnoticed,
and that she should thus lag at the tail of the
procession was not in any way remarkable, as,
at the best of times, she was not much of a walker
and in her high-heeled Sunday shoes her progress
was always deliberate.</p>

<p>Looking ahead of her, she saw the landscape
still as a picture under the slanting, lurid sunlight.
It seemed to be painted with unnaturally
glaring tints, to be soaked in color. The grass,
crossed with long shadows, was of the greenness
of an aniline dye. The massed foliage of tree
groups showed a melting richness of shades, no
one clearly defined, all fused in a thick, opaque
lusciousness of greens. The air was motionless
and very clear. Where a passing carriage stirred
the dust the powdery cloud rose, spreading a
tarnishing blur on the crystalline clarity of the
scene. The sun injected these dust films with
gold, and they settled slowly, as if it made them
heavy like ground-up particles of metal.</p>

<p>Yet, to Berny, this hectic prospect looked gray;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
all color seemed sucked from it. It appeared
pale and alien, its comfortable intimacy gone.
She was like a stranger walking in a strange
place, a forlorn, remote land, where she felt
miserable and homesick. The sense of being
dazed was passing from her. Walking forward
with short, careful steps, she was slowly coming
to the meaning of her discovery&mdash;adjusting herself
to it, realizing its significance. She had an
uncomfortable sensation of not being able to
control the muscles round her mouth, so that if
spoken to she would have had difficulty in answering,
and would have been quite unable to smile.</p>

<p>An open carriage passed her, and she drew aside,
then mechanically looked after it as it rolled
forward. There was a single figure in it&mdash;a
woman. Berny could see her head over the
lowered hood, and the little parasol she held,
white with a black lace cover and having a joint
in the handle. Her eyes followed this receding
head, moving so evenly against the background
of trees. It soared along without sinking or
rising, with the even, forward flight of a bird,
passed Hannah and Josh and Hazel, turning to
drop on them quick looks, which seemed, from
its elevated position and the shortness of the
inspection, to have something of disdain in them.</p>

<p>As the carriage drew near Dominick, who
walked at the head of the line with Pearl by the
hand, Berny saw the head move, lean forward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
and then, as the vehicle overhauled and passed
the young man, turn at right angles and bow to
him. The wheel almost brushed his shoulder.
He drew back from it with a start and lifted his
hat. Hazel, who was walking just in front of
Berny, turned and projecting her lips so that they
stood out from her face in a red circle, hissed
through them,</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Lady Ryan!&#8221; and then in a slightly
louder key,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<small>THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The conversation with her old friend had upset
Mrs. Ryan. These were grievances she did not
talk of to all the world, and the luxury of such
plain speaking was paid for by a re-awakened
smart. The numb ache of a sorrow was always
with her, but her consciousness of it was dulled
in the diversion of every day&#8217;s occupations.
Bringing it to the surface this way gave it a
new vitality, and when the conversation was over
and the visitor gone it refused to subside into
its old place.</p>

<p>She went slowly up stairs, hearing the low
murmur of voices from the sitting-room where
Cornelia and Jack Duffy were still secluded.
Even the thought of that satisfactorily-budding
romance did not cheer her as it had done earlier
in the day. As she had told Cannon, she was
not the woman she had been. Old age was
coming on her and with it a softening of her iron
nature. She wanted her son, her Benjamin,
dearly beloved with all the forces of her maturity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
as his father had been with all the glow of her
youth.</p>

<p>In her own room she threw aside the lace curtains,
and looking out on the splendor of the
afternoon, determined to seek cheer in the open
air. Like all Californians she had a belief in
the healing beneficence of air and sunlight. As
the sun had soothed Berny of her sense of care
so now it wooed her enemy also to seek solace in
its balm. She rang for the servant and ordered
the carriage. A few minutes later, clad in rich
enshrouding black, a small and fashionable bonnet
perched on her head, she slowly made her way
down stairs and out to the sidewalk where the
victoria, glittering in the trim perfection of its
appointments and drawn by a pair of well-matched
chestnuts, stood at the curb.</p>

<p>The man on the box touched his hat with
respectful greeting and the Chinese butler, who
had accompanied her down the steps, arranged
the rug over her knees and stepped back with
the friendly &#8220;good-by,&#8221; which is the politeness
of his race. They respected, feared, and liked
her. Every domestic who had ever worked in
Delia Ryan&#8217;s service from the first &#8220;hired girl&#8221;
of her early Shasta days to the staff that now
knew the rigors of her dominion, had found her
a just and generous if exacting mistress. She
had never been unfair, she had never been unkind.
She was one of themselves and she knew how to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
manage them, how to make them understand
that she was master, and that no drones were
permitted in her hive; how to make them feel
that she had a heart that sympathized with them,
not as creatures of an alien class remotely removed
from her own, but as fellow beings, having the
same passions, griefs and hopes as herself.</p>

<p>As the carriage rolled forward she settled back
against the cushioned seat and let her eyes roam
over the prospect. It was the heart of the
afternoon, still untouched by chill, not a breath
stirring. Passing up the long drive which leads
to the park, the dust raised by wheels hung ruddy
in the air. The long shadows of trees striped
the roadway in an irregular black pattern, picked
out with spatterings of sunshine, like a spilled,
gold liquid. Belts of fragrance, the breaths of
flowering shrubs, extended from bushy coppices,
and sometimes the keen, acrid odor of the eucalyptus
rose on the air. From this lane of entrance
the park spread fan-like into a still, gracious
pleasance. The rich, golden light slept on level
stretches of turf and thick mound-shaped groups
of trees. The throb of music&mdash;the thin, ethereal
music of out-of-doors&mdash;swelled and sank; the
voices of children rose clear and fine from complicated
distances, and once the raucous cry of
a peacock split the quietness, seeming to break
through the pictorial serenity of the lovely,
dreamy scene.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>Mrs. Ryan sat without movement, her face set
in a sphinx-like profundity of expression. People
in passing carriages bowed to her but she did not
see them and their salutes went unreturned.
Her vision was bent back on scenes of her past,
so far removed from what made up the present,
so different and remote from her life to-day,
that it did not seem as if the same perspective
could include two such extremes. Even her
children were not links of connection between
those old dead times and now. They had been
born when Con&#8217;s fortunes were in the ascendant.
They had known none of the privations of the
brave days when she and her man had faced
life together, young, and loving, and full of hope.</p>

<p>The carriage ascended a slight rise, and the
sea, a glittering plain, lay in full view. It met
the sky in a white dazzle of light. All its expanse
coruscated as if each wave was crested with
tinsel, and where they receded from the beach
it was as though a web of white and shining
tissue was drawn back, torn and glistening, from
the restraining clutch of the sand. The smooth
bareness of fawn-colored dunes swept back from
the shore. They rose and fell in undulations,
describing outlines of a suave, fluid grace, lovely
as the forms of drifting snow, or the swell of
waves. Ocean and dunes, for all the splendor of
sky and sun that overarched and warmed them,
suggested a gaunt, primeval desolation. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
had the loneliness of the naked earth and the
unconquerable sea&mdash;were a bit of the primordial
world before man had tamed and softened it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ryan swept them with a narrow, inward
gaze which saw neither, but, in their place, the
house in Virginia City, where she and Con had
lived when they were first married in the early
sixties. It was of &#8220;frame&#8221;&mdash;raw, yellow boards
with narrow strips of wood nailed over every
seam to keep the wind out. There had been a
rough porch on one side where her wash-tub had
stood. Out-of-doors there in the summer weather
she had bent over the wash-board most of the day.
She had made enough money to furnish the
prospect hole that Con was working, with tools
and miner&#8217;s supplies. Little Dick was born there;
he had died afterward in Shasta. He used to
lie in a wash-basket on the soiled linen in the sun.
He would have been forty-five now, sixteen years
older than Dominick.</p>

<p>She gave an order to the coachman who, drawing
up, turned the horses, and the carriage started
on its return trip. The sun was behind it, painting
with level, orange rays the thick foliage of trees
and the backs of foot passengers. Whatever it
touched had the appearance of being overlaid
with a gilded glaze through which its natural
colors shone, deepened and brilliant.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ryan&#8217;s memories had leaped from Virginia
City to Shasta. After Con&#8217;s prospect at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
Gold Hill had &#8220;petered&#8221; they had moved to
California, been members of that discouraged
route which poured, impoverished in pocket and
enfeebled in health, from the wreck of the gutted
Nevada camp back to their own Golden State
and its beguiling promises. They had opened a
grocery in Shasta in sixty-eight, first a little place
where Con and she waited behind the counter, then,
when they began to prosper, a big store on the
corner. &#8220;Ryan&#8217;s&#8221; was written over the entrance
in the beginning, when they had no money to
spend, in black on a strip of canvas, after that
in gold letters on a handsome sign. She had
kept the books there while Con had managed
the business, and they had done well. It was
the beginning of their prosperity and how they
had worked for it! Night after night up till
midnight and the next morning awake before
the birds. Two children had died there and
three had been born. It had been a full life, a
splendid life, the best a woman could know,
working for her own, making them a place in
the world, fighting her way up, shoulder to shoulder
with her man.</p>

<p>Money had been her goal. She had not wanted
to hoard it; of itself it meant nothing to her.
She had wanted it for her children: to educate
them better than she had been educated, to give
them the advantages she had never known, to
buy pleasures and position and consideration for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
them. She had felt the insignificance of poverty,
and she was determined that they should never
feel it. They should have the power that it
seemed to Delia Ryan money alone gave, the
thing she had none of, when, in her ragged
girlhood, she winced and chafed under the dominance
of those she felt to be her inferiors. She
was a materialist by nature, and life had made
her more of one. Money conquered, money broke
the trail that led everywhere, money paid the
gate entrance to all paradises. That was what
she had always thought. And now when she
was close on seventy, and her strength to fight
for the old standards and ward off the creeping
chill of age was weakened, she had come to
realize that perhaps it was not the world-ruling
power she had thought it. She had come to see
it could turn upon one in strange ways. It
carried power and it carried a curse. Dominick,
whose life it was to have made brilliant, whose
career it was to have crowned, Dominick had
lost all through it.</p>

<p>She was thinking this as the carriage swept
into the wider reach of the drive near the band
stand. Though the music was still throbbing
on the air, people were already leaving. Broken
lines were detaching themselves from the seated
mass in the chairs, disappearing among the
trees, and straggling out into the road. The
wheels of the victoria almost brushed the shoulders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
of a little party that moved in irregular file
between the grass edge and the drive. Mrs.
Ryan let her uninterested glance touch the hatted
heads of the women and then move forward to
the man who headed the column. He held by
the hand a pretty, fair-haired child, who, leaning
out from his restraining grasp, walked a little
before him, looking back laughingly into his face.
Mrs. Ryan&#8217;s eyes, alighting on his back, became
suddenly charged with a fierce fixity of attention.
The carriage overhauled him and before he
looked up she leaned forward and saw his profile,
the brow marked by a frown, the child&#8217;s gay
prattle causing no responsive smile to break the
brooding gravity that held his features.</p>

<p>As he felt the vibration of the wheel at his
shoulder he started aside and looked up. When
he recognized his mother his face reddened, and,
with a quick smile, he lifted his hat. Her
returning salute was serious, almost tragically
somber. Then the victoria swept on, and he and
the child, neither for a moment speaking, looked
after the bonneted head that soared away before
them with a level, forward vibration, like a floating
bird, the little parasol held stiffly erect on its
jointed handle.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Ryan passed down the long park
entrance she thought no more of the past. The
sight of her son, heading the file of his wife&#8217;s
relations, his face set in an expression of heavy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
dejection, scattered her dreams of retrospect with
a shattering impact. She had never seen him
look so frankly wretched; and to intensify the
effect of his wretchedness was the sprawling line
of Iversons which surrounded him. They seemed,
to her furious indignation, like a guard cutting
him off from his kind, imprisoning him, keeping
him for themselves. They were publicly dragging
him at their chariot wheels for all the world to
see. His wife instead of getting less was getting
more power over him. She had made him ask
for the invitation to the ball and now she made
him escort herself and her sisters about on holidays.</p>

<p>The old woman&#8217;s face was dark with passion,
her pale lips set into a tight line. Money!
Money might make trouble and bring disappointment,
but it would talk to those people. Money
was all they were after. Well, they could have it!</p>

<p>She let three days go by before she made the
move she had determined on ten minutes after
she had passed Dominick. The Wednesday morning
following that Sunday&mdash;apparently a day of
innocuous and simple happenings, really so fraught
with Fate&mdash;she put on her outdoor things and,
dispensing with the carriage, went down town on
the car to see Bill Cannon.</p>

<p>The Bonanza King&#8217;s office was on the first floor
of a building owned by himself on one of the
finest Montgomery Street corners. It had been
built in the flush times of the Comstock and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
belonged to that epoch of San Francisco architecture
where long lines of windows were separated
by short columns and overarched by ornate embellishments
in wood. As Mrs. Ryan approached,
the gold letters on these windows gleamed
bravely in the sun. They glittered even on the
top-story casements, and her eye, traveling over
them, saw that they spelled names of worth,
good tenants who would add to the dignity and
revenues of such an edifice. She owned the
corner opposite, and it gave her a pang of emulative
envy to notice how shabby her building looked,
a relic of the sixties which showed its antiquity
in walls of brick, painted brown, and a restrained
meagerness of decoration in the matter of cornices.
For some time she had been thinking of
tearing it down and raising a new, up-to-date
structure on the site. It would yield a fine
interest on the investment and be a good wedding
jointure for Cornelia.</p>

<p>With her approach heralded by a rustling of
rich stuffs and a subdued panting, she entered
the office. A long partition down one side of
the room shut off an inner sanctum of clerks.
Through circular openings she could see their
faces, raised expectantly from ledgers as their
ears caught the frou-frou of skirts and a step,
which, though heavy, was undoubtedly feminine.
She stopped at one of the circular openings where
the raised face looked older and graver than its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
fellows, and inquired for Mr. Cannon, giving her
name. In a moment the clerk was beside her,
knocking at a door which gave egress to still
more sacred inner precincts. Opening this,
he bowed her into the dimly-lit solemnity of the
Bonanza King&#8217;s private office. Back in the outer
room among the clerks he relieved the strained
curiosity of their faces with the remark,</p>

<p>&#8220;Greek&#8217;s meeting Greek in there. It&#8217;s Mrs.
Con Ryan.&#8221;</p>

<p>The private office looked out on an alley shut
in a perpetual twilight by the towering walls of
surrounding buildings. The long windows that
ran from the floor to the ceiling could not let in
enough light ever to make it a bright room, and
the something of dimness seemed appropriate to
the few massive pieces of furniture and the great
safe in the corner, with its lock glimmering from
the dusk of continual shadow. Men from windows
across the alley could look into the office
and see to whom Bill Cannon was talking, and
it was known that, for this reason, he had another
suite of rooms on one of the upper floors. But
that that most competent of business women,
Con Ryan&#8217;s widow, should come to his lair to
parley with him was natural enough, and if the
watchers across the alley saw her it only added
to their sober respect for the man who was
visited in his office by the richest woman in
California.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>She did not waste time beating about the bush.
Sitting beside the desk, facing the pale light from
the long windows, she very quickly plunged into
the matter of her errand. It was a renewal of the
conversation of the previous Sunday. Cannon sat
in his swivel chair, looking meditatively at her.
He had expected her, but not so soon, and as he
watched her his face showed a mild friendly surprise
breaking through its observant attention.
It would have been difficult for any one, even so
astute a woman as Mrs. Ryan, to guess that her
request for his assistance in severing Dominick&#8217;s
marriage bonds was affording the old man the
keenest gratification.</p>

<p>Their talk lasted nearly an hour. Before the
interview ended they had threshed out every
aspect of the matter under discussion. There
would be no loose ends or slighted details in
any piece of work which engaged the attention
of this bold and energetic pair of conspirators.
The men on the other side of the alley looked
down on them, wondering what business was
afoot between Mrs. Con Ryan and Bill Cannon,
that they talked so long in the big dim office
with its gloomy mahogany furniture and the

<small>THE GOD DESCENDS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Two days after this momentous combination of
her enemies, Berny was sitting in the parlor of
her flat, writing a letter. It was three o&#8217;clock in
the afternoon and she had just dressed herself
for her daily jaunt down town, where she spent
an hour or two looking into the shop windows,
pricing articles of apparel, taking a glass of soda
water, and stopping for chats with acquaintances
under awnings and in open doorways. Her life
was exceedingly barren of occupation and companionship.
When she had married, she had
dropped all work save such as seemed to her
fitting for the wife of a rich man. Outside her
sisters she had no friends. She knew the wives
of several of the bank officials and to them, as
representing a rise in the social scale, she clung
hopefully. The letter she was now writing was
to one of them who had taken a sick child to the
country.</p>

<p>She had finished it, and was inscribing her
signature, when a ring at the bell caught her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
ear. She raised her head listening, and then
bent it again over the letter. Visitors were too
rare at the Sacramento Street flat for her to cherish
any delusive hopes. Writing the address in her
best hand, she did not hear a foot ascending the
stairs, nor know that it actually was a visitor,
till a tap on the door-post of the room made her
turn and ejaculate a startled &#8220;Come in!&#8221; The
door that led from the parlor to the hall had been
removed, and a bamboo porti&egrave;re hung in the
opening. A large masculine hand thrust apart
the hanging strands, and Bill Cannon, hat in
hand, confident and yet apologetic, entered the
room.</p>

<p>He had been surprised when he had seen how
small and unpretentious was the home of Con
Ryan&#8217;s only son. He was more than ever surprised
when the Chinaman, with the unveiled
impudence of those domestics when the employes
of masters they do not like, had waved his proffered
card aside, and with a jerk of his head
motioned him forward to a doorway at the end
of the passage. Now, on entering, he took in, in
an impressionistic sweep, the overcrowded, vulgar
garishness of the little room, saturated with the
perfume of scents and sachets, and seeming to
be the fitting frame for the woman who rose from a
seat by the desk.</p>

<p>She looked at him inquiringly with something
of wariness and distrust in her face. She was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
last of the ascending scale of surprises he had
encountered, for she was altogether better-looking,
more a person to be reckoned with, than he
had expected. His quick eye, trained to read
human nature, recognized the steely determination
of this woman before she spoke, saw it in the
level scrutiny of her eyes, in the decision of her
close mouth. He felt a sensation, oft experienced
and keenly pleasurable, of gathering himself
together for effort. It was the instinct of an
old warrior who loves the fray.</p>

<p>Berny, on her side, knew him at the first glance,
and her sensations were those of disturbance and
uneasiness. She remembered him to be a friend
of the Ryans&#8217;, and she had arrived at the stage
when any friend of the Ryans&#8217; was an enemy of
hers. She was instantly in arms and on the
defensive. Rose had not yet taken shape in her
mind as a new, menacing force conniving against
her. Besides, she had no idea that Rose reciprocated
the sentiment that Dominick cherished for
her. Her discovery had only made her certain
that Dominick loved another woman. But this
had shaken her confidence in everything, and she
looked at the old man guardedly, ready for an
attack and bracing herself to meet it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll pardon this intrusion, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
he said in a deep, friendly voice, and with a
manner of cordial urbanity. &#8220;I tried to do it
correctly, but the Chinaman had other designs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
It was he who frustrated me. Here&#8217;s the card
I wanted him to take to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He approached her, holding out a card which
she took, still unsmiling, and glanced at. Her
instinct of dissimulation was strong, and, uneasy
as she was, she pretended to read the name, not
wanting him to see that she already knew him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. William G. Cannon,&#8221; she read, and then
looked up at him and made a slight inclination of
her head as she had seen actresses do on the
stage. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you sit down, Mr. Cannon?&#8221;
she added, and completed the impressiveness of
her greeting by a gesture, which also suggested
a histrionic origin, toward an adjacent chair.</p>

<p>He backed toward the chair, pulling it out into
the unencumbered space in the middle of the
floor, his movements deliberate and full of design,
as if he felt comfortably at home. Subsiding into
the seat, which had arms and was rather cramped
for his large bulk, he laid his hat among the
knick-knacks of a near-by table and said smilingly,</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, let me make my apologies for coming.
In the first place, I&#8217;m an old man. We&#8217;ve got
a few privileges to compensate us for the loss of
so much that&#8217;s good. Don&#8217;t you think that&#8217;s
fair, Mrs. Ryan?&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny liked him. There was something so easy
and affable in his manner, something that made
her feel he would never censure her for her past,
or, in fact, think about it at all. But she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
still on her guard, though the embarrassment she
had felt on his entrance disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said vaguely. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know why an old man should have more privileges
than a young one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you do know,&#8221; he said quickly, and giving
a short, jolly laugh, &#8220;that an old man who&#8217;s
known your husband all his life can have the
privilege of calling on you without an introduction.
You&#8217;ll admit that, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned out of the narrow chair, his broad
face creased with a good-humored smile, and his
eyes, keen and light-colored, sharp on hers.
Berny felt doubtful as to whether she liked him
so much. She, too, had a large experience of
men, and the hard intelligence of the eyes in the
laughing face made her more than ever on the
defensive.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m very glad you came,&#8221; she said
politely; &#8220;any friend of Dominick&#8217;s is welcome
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been that for a good many years. My
friendship with the Ryans goes back to the days
before Dominick was born. I knew Con and
Delia well in the old times in Virginia when we
were all young there together, all young, and
strong, and poor. I&#8217;ve known Dominick since
he was a baby, though I haven&#8217;t seen much of him
of late years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor of his wife either,&#8221; Berny was going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
say, but she checked herself and substituted,
&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; a comment which seemed to her
to have the advantages of being at once dignified
and elegantly non-committal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I knew Con when he was working on a
prospect of his own called the Mamie R at
Gold Hill. I was a miner on the Royal Charles
close by on steady wages. Con was in for himself.
He was playing it in pretty hard luck.
If it hadn&#8217;t been for his wife he couldn&#8217;t have
hung on as long as he did. She was a fine, husky,
Irish girl, strong as a man; and the washing she
used to do on the back porch of the shanty kept
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve heard that,&#8221; said Berny, much
interested, and hoping that her visitor would
continue to indulge in further reminiscences of
Mrs. Ryan&#8217;s lowly beginnings.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was forty-five years ago,&#8221; he went on,
&#8220;and the fellows that were on top then are underneath
now, and vice versa. But Delia Ryan&#8217;s
just about the same. There&#8217;s no shifting, or
changing, or not knowing her own mind about her.
She&#8217;s one of the strongest women in California;
one of the biggest women anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was not what Berny had expected, and
was more than she could subscribe to. The
distinguished position of her guest made her
want to be polite, but there was a limit to her
powers of diplomatic agreement. A silver blotter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
stood on the desk, and she took it up and began
absently rolling it back and forth over her letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;She seems to be a great friend of yours?&#8221;
she said, watching the blotter with lowered eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s all that,&#8221; he answered heartily. &#8220;One
of the greatest. She is to any one who knows her
well. She&#8217;s a big nature; nothing picayune or
small about her. A true friend and a fair enemy.
She&#8217;s the most generous woman I ever knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t seen much of her generosity,&#8221;
said Berny. Her words did not come with suddenness,
but slowly, with a measured and biting
deliberation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got your chance to see it now,&#8221;
answered the old man.</p>

<p>Berny looked at him, a side glance from the
corner of one long, dark eye. Her face was perfectly
grave and the eyes fixed on him were imbued
with a considering, apprehensive expectancy.
He looked very large, squeezed into the small
chair, but he seemed oblivious to the fact that
there was anything ridiculous in his appearance,
as well as to his own discomfort. The easy good-humor
had gone from his face. It was alert,
shrewd, and eagerly interested. Berny knew now
that he had not come to pay his respects to
Dominick&#8217;s wife. A sensation of internal trembling
began to possess her and the color deepened
in her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;How have I got my chance?&#8221; she said. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
guess if you know the Ryans so well you must
know that they won&#8217;t have anything to do with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll have a good deal to do with you if
you&#8217;ll let them,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>There was a momentary pause, during which&mdash;now
conscious of battle and menace&mdash;Berny strove
to control her rising excitement and keep her
head cool. He watched her with a glance which
had the boring penetration of a gimlet.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s funny,&#8221; she said, &#8220;not wanting to
speak to me for two years and then all of a sudden
wanting to have a good deal to do with me. It&#8217;s
a sort of lightning-change act, like you see at
the Orpheum. I guess I&#8217;d understand it better
if I knew more about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll tell you. Will you let me speak
frankly, Mrs. Ryan? Have I got your permission
to go right ahead and talk the plain talk that&#8217;s
the only way a plain man knows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Berny. &#8220;Go right ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at the carpet for a considering
moment, then raised his eyes and, gazing into
hers with steady directness, said,</p>

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be fair if I pretended not to know
that you and your husband&#8217;s family are unfriendly.
I know it, and that they have, as you say, refused
to know you. They&#8217;ve not liked the marriage;
that&#8217;s the long and the short of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what right have they got&mdash;&#8221; began Berny,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
raising her head with a movement of war, and
staring belligerently at him. He silenced her
with a lifted hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s go into that. Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s bother
ourselves with the rights and wrongs of the
matter. We could talk all afternoon and be
just where we were at the beginning. Let&#8217;s have
it understood that our attitude in this is businesslike
and impersonal. They don&#8217;t like the marriage&mdash;that&#8217;s
admitted. They&#8217;ve refused to know
you&mdash;that&#8217;s admitted. And let us admit, for the
sake of the argument, that they&#8217;ve put you in a
damned disagreeable position.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny, sitting stiffly erect, all in a quiver of
nerves, anger, and uncertainty, had her eyes fixed
on him in a glare of questioning.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all true,&#8221; she said grimly. &#8220;That&#8217;s a
statement I&#8217;ll not challenge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll agree that your position is disagreeable,
and that it&#8217;s been made so by the antagonism
of your husband&#8217;s family. Now, Mrs. Ryan,
let me tell you something that maybe you don&#8217;t
understand. You&#8217;re never going to conquer or
soften your mother-in-law. I don&#8217;t know anything
about it, but perhaps I can make a guess.
You&#8217;ve thought you&#8217;d win her over, that you&#8217;d
married her son and made him a good wife and
that some day she&#8217;d acknowledge that and open
her doors and invite you in. My dear young lady,
just give up building those castles in the air.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
There&#8217;s nothing in them. You don&#8217;t know Delia
Ryan. She&#8217;ll never bend and the one thing
that&#8217;ll break her is death. She&#8217;s got no hard
feelings against you except as her son&#8217;s wife.
That&#8217;s the thing she&#8217;ll never forgive you for. I&#8217;m
not saying it&#8217;s not pretty tough on you. I&#8217;m
just stating a fact. What I do say is that she&#8217;s
never going to be any different about it. She&#8217;s
started on her course, and she&#8217;s going to go straight
along on the same route till she comes to the
place where we&#8217;ve all got to jump off.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the commencement of this speech, a surge
of words had boiled up within Berny. Now as
he stopped she leaned toward him and the words
burst out of her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what right has she got to act that way,
I&#8217;d like to know? What&#8217;s she got against me?
What&#8217;s wrong with me? Dominick Ryan married
me of his own free will. He chose me and he was of
age. I&#8217;d been a typewriter in the Merchants and
Mechanics Trust Company, honestly earning my
living. Is that what she don&#8217;t like about me? I
might have got my living another way, a good sight
easier and pleasanter, but I wasn&#8217;t that kind. Maybe
she didn&#8217;t like a decent working-girl for her son&#8217;s
wife? And what was she to kick? Didn&#8217;t you just
say now she washed for the miners in Virginia?
Didn&#8217;t she used to keep a two-room grocery at
Shasta? I don&#8217;t see that there&#8217;s anything so
darned aristocratic about that. There were no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
more diamond tiaras and crests on the harness in
her early days than there are in mine. She&#8217;s forgetting
old times. You can just tell her I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>

<p>She came to a breathless close, her body bent
forward, her dark eyes burning with rage and
excitement. This suddenly sank down, chilled,
and, as it were, abashed by the aspect of her
listener, who was sitting motionless in his chair,
his hands clasped over the curving front of his
torso, his chin sunk on his collar, and his eyes
fixed upon her with a look of calm, ruminating
attention. Her words had not only failed to heat
him to controversy, but he had the air of patiently
waiting for them to cease, when he could resume
the matter under discussion.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s natural enough that you should feel
that way about it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but let&#8217;s put out
of the argument these purely personal questions.
You think one way and Mrs. Ryan thinks another.
We recognize that and assume that it is so.
We&#8217;re not passing judgment. I&#8217;d be the last one
to do that between two ladies. What I came to
talk of to-day was not the past but the present;
not the wrongs you&#8217;ve suffered from the Ryans,
but the way they can be righted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one way they can be righted,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well now, let&#8217;s see,&#8221; persuasively. &#8220;We&#8217;re
both agreed that your position in San Francisco
is hard. Here you are in the town where you were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
born and raised, leading a lonely life in what,
considering your marriage, we might call reduced
circumstances. You have&mdash;you&#8217;ll excuse my plain
talking&mdash;little or no social position. Your life
is monotonous and dull, when, at your age, it
should be all brightness and pleasure. In the
height of your youth and beauty you&#8217;re cramped
in a small flat, deprived of the amusements of
your age, ostracized from society, and pinched by
lack of money. That seems to me a pretty mean
position for a woman of your years and appearance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny made no answer. She was confused by
his thus espousing her cause, using almost the
words she herself would have used in describing
her unmerited trials. She was one of those women
who, with an almost unbreakable nerve, when
attacked or enraged, tremble. She was seized now
with this trembling and to control it clasped her
hands tight in her lap and tried to hold her body
stiff by will power.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is from this situation,&#8221; he went on, his
voice slightly lowered, &#8220;that Mrs. Ryan offers to
release you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A gleam of light zigzagged through the woman&#8217;s
uncomprehension, and the trembling seemed to
concentrate in her knees and stomach.</p>

<p>&#8220;To release me?&#8221; she repeated with a rising
inflection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. She&#8217;ll make it possible for you to escape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
from all this, to live in the way you ought to
live, and to have the position and amusements
you are entitled to. As I said to you before,
she&#8217;s got no ill feeling toward you except as her
son&#8217;s wife. She wishes you well, and to prove
it she is ready to make you the most generous
offer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny&#8217;s rigidity relaxed and she leaned against
the chair-back. She said nothing, but her eyes
remained fixed on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you she was generous and see if I am
not right,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;She will make you
a rich woman, independent of any one, the
money yours to do with as you like, if you&#8217;ll
consent to the few conditions she exacts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you will leave your husband for a year
and at the end of that time ask him to give you
your liberty, he suing you for divorce on the
ground of desertion.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause. Berny had moved her
eyes from the old man&#8217;s face, and was looking
at the blotter upon which her hand had again
closed. The cheek turned to him was a deep
rose pink. He looked at her unembarrassed and
inquiring, as though he had made an ordinary
business proposition.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bribe,&#8221; she said slowly, &#8220;a bribe to
leave my husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t say <i>that</i>,&#8221; he answered with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
deprecating shrug. &#8220;Call it a deal, a settlement.
The terms are easy and favorable. You&#8217;ll not
find one of them unjust or unfair. You&#8217;re to
leave the city, going preferably to Chicago or
New York and staying there for the period of
desertion. Seven thousand dollars will be set
aside for your expenses. At the end of the year
you are to write to Dominick telling him you no
longer want to live with him and asking him to
give you your freedom. After the divorce is
granted the sum of fifty thousand dollars will be
handed over to you, the one condition being that
you will leave the country and go to Europe.
It is also understood, of course, that the matter&#8217;s
to be kept a secret from Dominick. He must
think that you are acting entirely from your
own free will. He mustn&#8217;t guess his mother&#8217;s
had any part in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not ashamed to try to buy me off,
but she&#8217;s ashamed to have her precious boy
know it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man looked at her with a slight, indulgent
smile, inwardly wondering how Dominick
Ryan had endured life with this woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s best not to have Dominick know,&#8221; he
said easily; &#8220;not because there&#8217;s anything to be
ashamed of, but on general principles it&#8217;s best to
have as few complications as possible in the way
of other people&#8217;s butting in. What good would
there be in Dominick&#8217;s knowing?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>She rolled the blotter back and forth for a
moment without answering, then said,</p>

<p>&#8220;So Mrs. Ryan offers me fifty thousand dollars
to desert my husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With one condition&mdash;that you leave the
country. Just look what that&#8217;s going to mean!&#8221;
He rose from the narrow, upholstered seat, took
a light chair that stood near by and, setting it
close to her, sat sidewise on it, one hand extended
toward her. &#8220;Fifty thousand dollars is a good
bit of money over here, but over there it&#8217;s a
fortune. You&#8217;d be a rich woman with that amount
in your own right. You could take an apartment
in Paris, or a slice of some prince-feller&#8217;s palace
down in Rome. On the income of that capital,
safely invested, you could live in a style that
only a millionaire can manage over here&mdash;have
your own carriage, dress like a queen, go to the
opera. They like Americans, especially when
they&#8217;ve got money. First thing you know you&#8217;d
be right in it, knowing everybody, and going
everywhere. You&#8217;re nobody here, worse than
nobody. Over there you&#8217;d be one of the people
everybody was talking about and wanted to
know. You&#8217;re not only a pretty woman, you&#8217;re
a smart woman; you could get on top in no time,
marry into the nobility if you wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny, her eyes on the blotter, said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s the alternative over here?&#8221; the
tempter continued. &#8220;Staying on as an outsider,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
being in a position where, though you&#8217;re lawfully
married and are living decently with your
husband, you&#8217;re ostracized as completely as if
you weren&#8217;t married at all; where you&#8217;ve hardly
got enough to pay your way, cramped up in a
corner like this, never going anywhere or seeing
anybody. Does that kind of life appeal to you?
Not if <i>I</i> know anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny lifted her head and looked at him. The
color was now burning in her cheeks and her
eyes seemed to hold all the vitality of her rigid
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You tell Mrs. Ryan,&#8221; she said slowly, &#8220;that
I&#8217;ll lie dead in my coffin before I&#8217;ll take her
money and leave my husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>They looked at each other for a silent moment,
two strong and determined antagonists. Then
the old man said mildly and pleasantly,</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t be too hasty; don&#8217;t jump at a
decision in the heat of the moment. Just at the
first glimpse this way, you may feel surprised&mdash;may
take it as sort of out of the way and interfering.
But when you&#8217;ve thought it over, it will
look different. Take time. You don&#8217;t have to
make your mind up now, or to-morrow, or the
day after. Turn it over, look at the other side,
sleep on it for a few nights. Think a bit of the
things I&#8217;ve said. You don&#8217;t want to be hasty
about it. It&#8217;s not the kind of offer you get
every day.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not!&#8221; said Berny fiercely. &#8220;It&#8217;s too
dirty for most people. It&#8217;s too dirty for any one
but Mrs. Ryan, and you can tell her I said so.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose to her feet, still clenching the blotter
in her hand. He rose too, interested, annoyed
and disappointed, for he knew with a cynical
certainty just about what she was going to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she cried, stiff and quivering like a
leaf, &#8220;go and tell her! Tell her just what I
said. I&#8217;ll see her in hell before I&#8217;ll take a cent of
her money, or budge an inch out of this house.
She&#8217;s a fine one to give herself such airs, and
think herself too good to know me and then offer
to buy me off like a kept woman. Tell her I&#8217;m
her son&#8217;s wife, and I&#8217;ll stay so till she&#8217;s good and
dead, and Dominick&#8217;s got his share of his father&#8217;s
estate. Tell her I&#8217;m here to stay, right here,
here in this flat, just round the corner from where
she lives, and that I&#8217;m Mrs. Ryan as well as she
is, and that I&#8217;m going to stay so. This is my
home, here in San Francisco, where she&#8217;s tried
to ruin me and freeze me out, and here I stick.&#8221;</p>

<p>She glared at him as he stood, one hand on
the back of his chair, his eyes thoughtfully fixed
on her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be too hasty if I were you,&#8221; he
said pacifically. &#8220;Things done in a hurry are
rarely satisfactory. It&#8217;s a bad way to do business.
You&#8217;re apt to let good chances slip by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid,&#8221; she said with grim significance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to let mine slip by. I&#8217;ve
married Dominick Ryan and I&#8217;m going to stay
by him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to the table and picked up his hat,
which was a soft, black felt wide-awake. As he
dented it into shape, he said,</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sort of heated up and excited now,
and a person&#8217;s brain don&#8217;t work well in that
state. You don&#8217;t want to come to any important
conclusions when you&#8217;re not cool and able to
think. Sleep on this thing for one night, anyway.
You can call me up on the telephone to-morrow,
or probably it would be better to send a line by
a messenger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very much interested in this affair,
aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; she said with sudden malicious
meaning.</p>

<p>For the first time in the interview he was
slightly taken aback. Her face held a reserve
of knowledge with which she seemed to be silently
taunting him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; he said with an air of simple
frankness, &#8220;as an old family friend would be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s the only reason?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What other could there be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know&#8221;&mdash;she turned and dropped
the blotter on the desk with a nonchalant movement&mdash;&#8220;I
was just wondering.&#8221;</p>

<p>He eyed her for a second without speaking,
and in this one moment of scrutiny allowed a look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
of dislike and menace to creep into his face.
Then he said genially,</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess this brings our interview to an
end. It&#8217;s not been just what you&#8217;d call a pleasant
one, but I for one can say it&#8217;s left no hard feelings.
I hope you&#8217;ll admit as much.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders and turned to the
desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a good one at lies,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
leave that to the Ryans and their old family
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed good-humoredly and answered,</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right. You never can hurt me
by plain speaking. That&#8217;s the only kind I know.
I guess we&#8217;re neither of us great at guff. Remember
that I&#8217;ll expect a visit or a letter from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to wait a long time for either,&#8221;
she said without moving.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m a patient man, and everything
comes to him who waits.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked over her shoulder with a slight acid
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not <i>everything</i>,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;So long,&#8221; he answered, giving his hat a farewell
wave at her. &#8220;I&#8217;ve enjoyed meeting you
and hope we&#8217;ll soon meet again in a more friendly
way. <i>Hasta Manana, Se&ntilde;ora!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>She wheeled so that she faced him and gave
a short nod, then watched him as he walked to
the door. Here he turned, bowed deeply and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
respectfully, and passed out into the hall, the
bamboo strands of the porti&egrave;re clashing together
behind him. A moment later she heard the bang
of the street door.</p>

<p>She stood motionless in the middle of the room,
her face deeply flushed, her eyes fixed on the
swaying curtain. For the first few moments a
blind excitement held her, and then from the
welter of this, her thoughts separated themselves
and took definite directions. Rage, triumph,
bewilderment, alarm, surged to the surface of
her mind. Shaken by one after another she
stood rigid in the intensity of her preoccupation,
not noticing the shaking of her knees or the
thumping of her heart.</p>

<p>Her two predominant sensations were rage and
triumph. The insult of the bribe burned in her&mdash;this
flinging money at her as it might be flung at
a cast-off mistress. It deepened her detestation
of the Ryans, and at the same time gave her a
sense of intimacy with them. It made them
more on a par with her, drew them down from
the lofty heights whence they had scornfully
ignored her, to a place beside her, a place where
they, as well as she, did underhand, disreputable
things they did not want known.</p>

<p>And it showed her her power. Standing in
the middle of the room with her eyes still staring
at the now motionless porti&egrave;re strands, she saw,
stretching away into a limitless gilded distance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
her negotiations with her husband&#8217;s family. If
their desire to rupture the marriage took them
thus far, where might it not take them? She
stared into a future where she saw herself extracting
money in vast amounts from them. It was
fortune&mdash;twice, three times this first paltry sum&mdash;waiting
for her when she chose to stretch her
hand and take it. She could be rich, as the old
man said; she could go abroad, see the world,
have all the joys that riches give, when she chose
to let Mrs. Ryan humbly pay her such a sum as
she would accept.</p>

<p>With a quick catch of her breath, she turned
and moved to the window, stirred to her depth
with the exultation of unexpected power. And
standing there, the thought of the old man
suddenly swept across her, and with it, transfixing
her in an attitude of frozen, inward contemplation,
the memory of his daughter. New vistas, extending
away through the abruptly-illuminated dimness
of her previous ignorance, suddenly opened before
her, and she sent her startled vision exploring
down them. At the end of them, waiting for
Dominick in an attitude of welcome, was the
pink and white girl she had seen in the park.</p>

<p>The discovery was made so quickly, came upon
her flushed complacency with such a shock of
unexpectedness, that even her sharp, suspicious
mind could not for the moment take it in. Then
Miss Cannon&#8217;s face, as she had seen it in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
moment of recognition in the park, rose with
confirming clearness on her memory, and she saw
straight to the heart of the plot. It was not the
Ryans alone who wanted to buy her off. It
was the Cannons as well. They not only wanted
Dominick to get rid of her; they wanted him to
get rid of her so that he could marry Rose Cannon.
The other girl was behind it all, accounted for the
participation of the Bonanza King, accounted probably
for the whole move&mdash;the pink and white girl
in the French clothes who had all her life had everything
and now wanted Berny Iverson&#8217;s husband.</p>

<p>Poor Dominick, whom Berny had held contemptuously
as a disappointing and aggravating appurtenance
of hers, suddenly rose in her estimation
into a valuable possession whose worth she had
not before realized. It was enough that another
woman wanted him, was, through underhand
channels, trying to get him. All in a minute,
Berny had changed from the negligent proprietor
of a valueless and lightly-held object, to the
possessor of an article of rare worth, which she
was prepared jealously to guard. With a sort of
proud challenge she felt that she stood valiantly
facing the marauders, protecting her treasure
against their predatory advances. And her hatred
against Mrs. Ryan began to extend toward Bill
Cannon, and beyond him toward the fair-faced
girl, who grew red to her forehead when she
accidentally encountered Dominick Ryan.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>THE MOONLIGHT NIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>A few nights after this, there was a full moon.
Dominick, walking home from the bank, saw it
at the end of the street&#8217;s vista, a large, yellowish-pink
disk floating up into the twilight. The air
about it was suffused with a misty radiance, and
its wide glowing face, having a thin look like a
transparency of paper with a light behind it,
seemed, though not yet clear of the housetops,
already to dominate the sky. The evening was
warm, like the early summer in other climates;
and Dominick, walking slowly and watching the
great yellow sphere deepening in color as it swam
majestically upward, thought of evenings like
this in the past when he had been full of the joy
of life and had gone forth in the spirit of love
and adventure.</p>

<p>The sight of his home dispelled these memories
and brought upon him the sense of his daily
environment and its distastefulness. The determination
to accept his fate which had been with
him on his return from Antelope had of late been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
shaken by stirrings of rebellion. Uplifted by the
thought of his love for a woman hopelessly
removed from him, but who would always be a
lodestar to worship reverently and to guide him
up difficult paths, he had been able to face his
domestic tragedy with the high resolution of the
martyr. But this exalted condition was hard to
maintain in the friction of daily life with Berny.
Before, she had merely been a disagreeable companion
of whom he had to make the best. Now,
she was that, intensified by a comparison which
threw out her every fault and petty vulgarity
into glaring prominence. And more than that&mdash;she
was the angel with the flaming sword, the
self-incurred, invited, domesticated angel&mdash;the
angel come to stay&mdash;who barred the way to
Paradise.</p>

<p>She seemed to him to have changed within the
last week. When he had first come home from
Antelope she had been Berny in one of her less
familiar but recognizable moods&mdash;Berny trying
to be agreeable, wearing her best clothes every
day, ordering the things for dinner he liked, talking
loudly and incessantly. Then, quite suddenly,
he became aware of a change in her. She grew
silent, absent-minded, morose. He had tried to
make their lives easier by always being polite
and carefully considerate of her and she had
responded to it. For the last few days she had
made no effort to assist him in this laudable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
design. Instead, she had been unresponsive,
preoccupied, uninvitingly snappish in her replies.
Several times he had been forced into the novel
position of &#8220;making conversation&#8221; throughout
dinner, exerting his wits for subjects to talk about
that he might lift the gloom and elicit some
response from the mute, scowling woman opposite.</p>

<p>To-night, the period of ill-humor seemed over.
Berny was not only once again her animated self,
she was almost feverishly garrulous. Dinner had
not progressed past the fish when she began to
question him on his recent experiences at Antelope.
The subject had come up several times
since his return, but for the last few days he had
had a respite from it, and hoped its interest had
worn away. She had many queries to make
about Bill Cannon, and from the father it was
but a natural transition to the daughter, so much
the more attractive of the pair. Dominick was
soon inwardly writhing under an exceedingly
ingenious and searching catechism.</p>

<p>Had he been less preoccupied by his own acute
discomfort, he might have noticed that Berny
herself gave evidence of disturbance. As she
prodded him with her questions, her face was
suffused with unusual color, and the eagerness of
her curiosity shone through the carelessness with
which she sought to veil it. Certain queries she
accompanied with a piercing glance of investigation,
watching with hungry sharpness the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
countenance of the persecuted man. Fearful of
angering her, or, still worse, of arousing her
suspicions, Dominick bore the examination with
all the fortitude he had, but he rose from the
table with every nerve tingling, rasped and galled
to the limit of endurance.</p>

<p>He did not come into the den immediately
but roamed about, into the parlor, down the
passage, and into his own room. He spread the
scent of his cigar and its accompanying films of
smoke all through the flat, a thing that Berny
would never have ordinarily allowed. To-night
she was too occupied in listening to his prowling
steps to bother about minor rules and regulations.
She saw in his restlessness a disturbance evoked
by her questionings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you coming into the den?&#8221; she called,
as she heard him pacing steadily along the passageway.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he called back. &#8220;The moonlight&#8217;s
shining in at every window. It makes me restless.
I don&#8217;t feel like sitting still.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat on the divan, a paper spread before her
face, but her eyes were slanted sidewise, unblinking
in the absorption of her attention. Suddenly
she heard a rattling sound which she knew to be
from the canes and umbrellas in the hat-rack.
She cast away the paper, and, drawing herself to
the edge of the divan, peered down the passage.
Dominick was standing by the hat-rack, his hat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
on the back of his head, his hand feeling among
the canes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got your hat on,&#8221; she called in a
high key of surprise. &#8220;You&#8217;re not going out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am,&#8221; he answered, drawing out the
cane he wanted. &#8220;It&#8217;s a fine night, and I&#8217;m going
for a walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For a walk?&#8221;&mdash;there was hesitancy in her
tone, and for a horrible moment, he thought she
was going to suggest coming with him. &#8220;Where
are you going to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know, just prowl about. I want
some exercise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to your mother&#8217;s?&#8221; she ventured,
not without some timidity.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going anywhere in
particular. Good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat forward, listening to his descending feet
and the bang of the hall door. A glance at the
window showed her it was, as he said, a fine night,
deluged with the radiance of the moon. Probably
he <i>was</i> just going out for a walk and not to see
anybody. He was always doing queer things
like that. But,&mdash;Berny sat staring in front of
her, biting her nails and thinking. Uneasiness
had been planted in her by Dominick&#8217;s flight to
Antelope. More poignant uneasiness had followed
that first attack. Now the bitter corrosive of
jealousy began to grow and expand in her.
Sitting huddled on the divan, she thought of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
Dominick, walking through the moonlight to
Rose Cannon, and another new and griping pang
laid hold upon her.</p>

<p>Outside, Dominick walked slowly, keeping to
the smaller and less frequented streets. It was
a wonderful night, as still as though the moon
had exerted some mesmeric influence upon the
earth. Everything was held motionless and
without sound in a trance-like quietude. In
the gardens not a blossom stirred. Where
leaves extended from undefined darknesses of
foliage, they stood out, stem and fiber, with a
carven distinctness, their shadows painted on the
asphalt walks in inky silhouette. There was no
lamplight to warm the clear, still pallor of the
street&#8217;s vista. It stretched between the fronts
of houses, a river of light, white and mysterious,
like a path in a dream.</p>

<p>It was a night for lovers, for trysts, and for
whispered vows. Dominick walked slowly, feeling
himself an outsider in its passionate enchantment.
The scents that the gardens gave out,
and through which he passed as through zones
of sweetness, were part of it. So were the sounds
that rose from the blotted vagueness of white
figures on a porch, from impenetrable depths of
shadow&mdash;laughter, low voices, little cries. In the
distance people were singing snatches of a song
that rose and fell, breaking out suddenly and
as suddenly dropping into silence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>His course was not aimless, and took him by a
slow upward ascent to that high point of the
city, whence the watcher can look down on the
bay, the rugged, engirdling hills, and the hollow
of North Beach. Here he stood, resting on his
cane, and gazing on the far-flung panorama, with
the white moon sailing high and its reflection
glittering across the water. Along the bases of
the hills the clotted lights of little towns shone
in faintly-glimmering agglomerations. At his
feet the hollow lay like a black hole specked with
hundreds of sparks. Each spark was the light
of a home, symbol of the fire of a hearth. He
stood looking down on them, thinking of what
they represented, that cherished center round
which a man&#8217;s life revolves, and which he, by
his own sin and folly, had lost for ever.</p>

<p>He walked on, skirting the hollow, and moving
forward through streets where old houses brooded
in overgrown gardens. The thin music of strings
rose on the night, and two men passed him playing
on the mandolin and guitar. They walked with
quick, elastic steps, their playing accurately in
accord, their bodies swaying slightly to its rhythm.
They swung by him, and the vibrating harmonies,
that sounded so frail and attenuated in the
suave largeness of the night, grew faint and
fainter, as if weighed upon and gradually extinguished
by the dense saturation of the moonlight.</p>

<p>Music was evidently a mode of expression that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
found favor on this evening of still brilliance.
A few moments later a sound of singing rose on
the air and a youthful couple came into view,
walking close together, their arms twined about
each other, caroling in serene indifference to such
wayfarers as they might meet. They passed
him, their faces uplifted to the light, their mouths
open in the abandon of their song. Unconscious
of his presence, with upraised eyes and clasping
arms, they paced on, filling the night with their
voices&mdash;a boy and girl in love, singing in the
moonlight. Dominick quickened his steps, hastening
from the sound.</p>

<p>The moon was now high in the sky and the
town lay dreaming under its spell. Below him
he could see the expanse of flat roofs, shining
surfaces between inlayings of shadow, with the
clefts of the streets cut through at regular intervals
like slices made by a giant knife. Now and
then he looked up at the dome above, clear and
solemn, the great disk floating in solitary majesty
across the vast and thoughtful heaven.</p>

<p>That part of California Street which crested
the hill was but a few blocks beyond him, and
before his mind would acknowledge it, his feet
had borne him that way. He thought only to
pass the Cannon house, to look at its windows,
and see their lights. As it rose before him, a
huge, pale mass checkered with shadows, the
longing to see it&mdash;the outer shell that hid his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
heart&#8217;s desire&mdash;passed into a keener, concentrated
agitation that seemed to press out from his soul
like a cry to her.</p>

<p>The porch yawned black behind pillars that in
the daytime were painted wood and now looked
like temple columns wrought in marble. Dominick&#8217;s
glance, sweeping the lines of yellowed
windows, finally rested on this cavern of shadow,
and he approached stealthily, as a robber might,
his body close to the iron fence. Almost before
his eyes had told him, he knew that a woman was
standing there, leaning against the balustrade that
stretched between the columns. A climbing rose
spread, in a mottling of darkness, over the wall
beside her. Here and there it was starred with
the small white faces of blossoms. As the young
man drew near she leaned over the balustrade,
plucked one of the blossoms, and, slowly shredding
the leaves from the stem, stretched out her hand
and let them fall, like a languid shower of silver
drops, to the grass.</p>

<p>Dominick halted below her, leaning against the
fence and looking up. She did not see him and
stretched out her hand again for another blossom.
The petals of this one fell through her fingers,
one by one, and lay, a scattering of white dots,
on the darkness of the grass. She bent over the
balustrade to look at them, and in doing so,
her eyes encountered the man below.</p>

<p>For a moment they looked at each other without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
speaking, then she said, her voice at the
lowest note that would reach him,</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Watching you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been standing there long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, only a few minutes. Why are you
pulling the roses to pieces?&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a little laugh and said something
that sounded like &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; and moved
back from the balustrade.</p>

<p>He thought she was going, and clutched the
iron spikes of the fence, calling up to her in a
voice of urgent feeling, curiously out of keeping
with the words, the first remark that came into
his head:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is very different from Antelope, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She came forward again and looked out and
up at the sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said gravely, &#8220;we had no moonlight
there, nothing but storms and gray clouds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it was lovely,&#8221; he answered in the same
key. &#8220;The clouds and the storms didn&#8217;t matter.
Those were three&mdash;three great weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ended lamely but they were the best
words he could get, trying to say something that
would keep her there, trying to see her through
the vaporous light. She bent over the railing
looking for another rose, but there were no more
within her reach and she gave the short, nervous
laugh she had given before and turned her eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
on him again. Then he realized that she was
agitated. The knowledge augmented his own
perturbation and for a moment he did not trust
himself to speak. He gazed at her fixedly, the
look of a lover, and was not conscious that she
wavered under it, till she suddenly drew a quick
breath, turned her head sidewise, and said, with
an effort at naturalness,</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I must go in. The roses are all picked
and papa&#8217;ll be wondering where I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed to Dominick just then that he could
not lose her. She must stay a moment longer.
Urgency that was imploring was in his voice as
he said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go! don&#8217;t go! Stay just one moment
longer! Can&#8217;t you come down and talk for a
minute? Come part of the way down. I want
to speak to you for a little bit longer. It may be
months before I see you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>She listened, wavered, and was won over.
Without answer she turned from the shadow of
the porch into the light on the top of the steps,
and from there slowly descended, her skirt gathered
in one hand, and the other touching the
baluster. She was in black and from its dead
density her arms, bare to the elbow, shone as
white as the arms of a marble woman. The
baluster ended in a lion crouching in sleep on a
slab of stone, and she paused here and Dominick
went up the few steps from the street to meet her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
With the sleeping lion between them they looked
at each other with troubled eyes.</p>

<p>The moonlight seemed to have drawn from the
meeting the artificialities of worldly expression,
which in the sensible, familiar daylight would
have placed it on the footing of a casual, to-be-expected
encounter. The sun beating down on
lovers beats some of their sentimental transports
out of them. Now in this mystic, beautifying
luminosity, the acquired point of view, the regard
for the accepted conventions of every-day seemed
to have receded to a great distance, to be thin,
forgotten things that had nothing to do with
real life. For a moment Berny ceased to be a
living presence, standing with a flaming sword
between them. They almost forgot her. The
memory that pressed upon them was that of
their last meeting. It shone in their eyes and
trembled on their lips. The sleeping lion that
separated them was a singularly appropriate
symbol.</p>

<p>Low-voiced and half-spoken sentences belonged
to this romantic moment. The moonlit night
around them was still and empty, but Dominick
spoke as though other ears than hers were listening:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve wanted so to see you. I came by to-night
hoping that perhaps I could catch a glimpse of
your shadow on the curtain. I didn&#8217;t expect
anything like this.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>He stopped, looking at her, and not listening to
the few words of her answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I wanted you so that my will called
you out,&#8221; he said in an impassioned whisper.</p>

<p>She said nothing and suddenly his hand sought
hers, clasped it tight on the head of the lion,
and he whispered again,</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Rose, if I could see you now and then&mdash;only
for a moment like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt her hand, small and cold, crush softly
inside his, and almost immediately was conscious
of her effort to withdraw it. He instantly loosened
his fingers, let hers slide from his grasp, and drew
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night,&#8221; she said hurriedly, and without
looking at him turned and went up the steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night,&#8221; he called after her, following her
ascending figure with his eyes.</p>

<p>When she reached the shadow at the top of
the steps, she called &#8220;Good-by,&#8221; passed into the
engulfing blackness, and was gone. He waited
till he heard the door bang behind her, then
descended the steps and walked slowly home,
his eyes on the pavement.</p>

<p>Berny was in her own room ready for bed when
she heard his ascending footsteps. She was
occupied in rubbing a skin-food into her face,
with careful circular motions and pinchings of
her finger-tips. It was a task that required deep
attention and which she performed three nights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
in the week with conscientious regularity. With
her face gleaming with grease she crept to her
door and listened, heard his cane slide into the
umbrella holder, and the door of his room shut
with a softness which told her that he thought her
asleep. She walked back to the glass and
resumed her manipulations, but with diminished
zeal. The clock on the bureau marked the hour
at half-past ten. Dominick had been out two
hours. Would a man walk round a city&mdash;even
a crank like her husband&mdash;all by himself for two
hours?</p>

<small>FAMILY AFFAIRS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Every summer afternoon the trade winds blow
through San Francisco, winging their way across
miles of chill, salt sea, and striking the bulwarked
city with a boisterous impact. The long streets
seem as paths, lines of least resistance, and the
winds press themselves into the narrow limits
and whoop buoyantly along, carrying before them
dust, rags, scraps of paper&mdash;sometimes hats.</p>

<p>Their period of highest recognized activity is
from May till September, but before that, vagrant
breezes, skirmishers sent out in advance, assault
the city. They follow on still, sunny mornings,
which show not the slightest warning symptom
of the riotous forces which are designing to seize
upon and disrupt the tranquillity of the afternoon.
Eleven sees them up and stirring; by midday they
have begun the attack. The city, in a state of
complete unpreparedness, is at their mercy and
they sweep through it in arrogant triumph, veiled
in a flying scud of dust. Unsuspecting wayfarers
meet them at corners, and stand, helpless victims<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
of a playfulness, fierce and disconcerting as that
of tigers. Hats, cleverly running on one rim,
career along the sidewalk. Ladies have difficulties
with parasols, heretofore docile and well-behaved.
Articles of dress, accustomed to hang decorously,
show sudden ambitions to rise and ride the
elements. And those very people who in winter
speak gratefully of the winds as &#8220;the scavengers
of San Francisco&#8221; may be heard calling curses
down on them.</p>

<p>Such a wind, the first of the season, was abroad
on a bright morning in early April, and Cornelia
Ryan was out in it. It was a great morning for
Cornelia. Even the wind could not ruffle her
joyousness. She was engaged. Two evenings
before, Jack Duffy, who had been hovering round
the subject for a month, poised above it, as
a hawk above delightful prey, had at last
descended and Cornelia&#8217;s anxieties were at an end.
She had been so relieved, elated, and flustered
that she had not been able to pretend the proper
surprise, but had accepted blushing, stammering
and radiant. She had been blushing, stammering
and radiant when she told her mother that night,
and to-day, forty-eight hours later, she was still
blushing, stammering, and radiant.</p>

<p>It was not alone that she was honestly in love
with Jack, but Cornelia, like most maidens in
California and elsewhere, was in love with being
admired, deferred to, and desired. And despite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
her great expectations and her prominent position,
she had had rather less of this kind of delightful
flattery than most girls. Walking down town in
the clear, sun-lit morning, she was, if not handsome,
of a fresh and blooming wholesomeness,
which is almost as attractive and generally wears
better. The passers-by might readily have set
her down as a charming woman, for whom men
sighed, and in this surmise been far from the
mark. She had had few lovers before Jack Duffy.
That matter-of-fact sturdiness, that absence of
softness and mystery so noticeable in Californian
women, was particularly accentuated in her case,
and had robbed her of the poetic charm of which
beauty and wealth can never take the place.</p>

<p>But to-day she was radiant, a sublimated,
exultant Cornelia, loved at last and by a man of
whom she could completely and unreservedly
approve. There were times when Cornelia&mdash;she
was thirty&mdash;had feared that she might have to
go abroad and acquire a foreign husband, or,
worse still, move to New York and make her
selection from such relics of decayed Knickerbocker
families as were in the market. She was
woman enough to refuse to die unwed. Now
these dark possibilities were dispelled. In her
own state, in her own town, she had found her
mate, Jack Duffy, whose father had known her
father and been shift boss under Bill Cannon in
the roaring days of Virginia City. It was like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
royalty marrying into its own order, the royalty
of Far Western millions, knowing its own ramifications
having its own unprinted Almanach de
Gotha&mdash;deep calling unto deep!</p>

<p>The wind was not yet out in force; its full,
steady sweep would not be inaugurated till early
in the afternoon. It came now in gusts which
fell upon Cornelia from the back and accelerated
her forward progress, throwing out on either side
of her a flapping sail of skirt. Cornelia, who was
neat and precise, usually resented this rough
handling, but to-day she only laughed, leaning
back, with one hand holding her hat. In the
shops where she stopped to execute various commissions
she had difficulty in suppressing her
smiles. She would have liked to delay over her
purchases and chat with the saleswomen, and
ask them about their families, and send those
who looked tired off for a month into the country.</p>

<p>It was after midday when she found herself
approaching that particular block, along the edge
of which the flower-venders place their baskets
and display their wares. In brilliantly-colored
mounds the flowers stood stacked along the outer
rim of the sidewalk, a line of them, a man behind
each basket vociferating the excellence of the
bouquet he held forward to the passer&#8217;s inspection.
In the blaze of sun that overlaid them, the piled-up
blossoms showed high-colored and variegated
as a strip of carpeting.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>Cornelia never bought flowers at the street
corners. The town house was daily supplied
from the greenhouses at the country place at
Menlo. When sick friends, anniversaries, or entertainment
called for special offerings they were
ordered from expensive florists and came in made-up
bunches, decorated with sashes of ribbon.
But to-day she hesitated before the line of laden
baskets. Some of the faces behind them looked
so dreary, and Cornelia could not brook the sight
of a dreary face on this day of joy. The dark,
wistful eyes of an Italian boy holding out a bunch
of faded jack roses, stiffly set in a fringe of fern,
made a sudden appeal to her and she bought the
roses. Then the old man who was selling carnations
looked so lean and grizzled that he must
be cheered, and two bunches of the carnations
were added to the roses. The boys and men, seeing
that the brilliant lady was in a generous mood,
collected about her, shouting out the excellences
of their particular blossoms, and pressing sample
bunches on her attention.</p>

<p>Cornelia, amused and somewhat bewildered,
looked at the faces and bought recklessly. She
was stretching out her hand to beckon to the
small boy with the wilted pansies, who was not
big enough to press through the throng, when a
man&#8217;s voice behind her caught her ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Cornelia, are you trying to corner the
curb-stone market?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>She wheeled swiftly and saw her brother,
laughing and looking at the stacked flowers in the
crook of her arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dominick!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;you&#8217;re just the
person I want to see. I was going to write to
you. I&#8217;ve got lots to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along then and take lunch with me.
I was on my way up to Bertrand&#8217;s when I saw
you. They&#8217;ll give us a good lunch there and you
can tell me all your secrets.&#8221;</p>

<p>The flower sellers, who had been listening with
unabashed eagerness, realized that their prey
was about to be ravished from them, and raised
their voices in a chorus of wailing appeal. As
Cornelia moved forward they moved round her,
thrusting bouquets under her eyes in a last hope,
the boy with the wilted pansies, on the brink of
tears, hanging on the outskirts of the crowd.
Cornelia might have forgotten him, but her eye,
sweeping back for an absent moment, saw his
face, bereft of all hope&mdash;a face of childish despair
above his drooping pansies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, boy with the pansies,&#8221; she called, and
sent a silver dollar through the air toward him,
&#8220;that&#8217;s for you. Keep it and the flowers, too.
I&#8217;ve too many now and can&#8217;t carry any more.
Maybe he&#8217;ll sell them to some one else,&#8221; she said
to Dominick, as they crossed the street. &#8220;He&#8217;s
such a little boy to be earning his bread!&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked up the street toward Bertrand&#8217;s,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
a French restaurant which for years had enjoyed
the esteem of the city&#8217;s gourmets. The wind was
now very high. It tore at Cornelia&#8217;s clothes and
made it necessary for Dominick to hold his hat
on, his hand spread flat on the crown. A trail
of blossoms, torn from the flowers each carried,
sprinkled the pavement behind them. Cornelia,
with her head down and her face toward her
brother, shouted remarks at him, every now and
then pausing in a stifle of laughter to struggle
with her draperies, which at one moment rose
rebellious, and at the next were wound about her
in an umbrella-like sheath.</p>

<p>They had often met this way in the past, when
the elder Mrs. Ryan&#8217;s wrath had been in its first,
untameable freshness, and her son had seen her
seldom. In those days of estrangement, Cornelia
had been the tie between Dominick and his home.
She loved her brother and was sorry for him,
and had felt the bitterness of the separation,
not alone as a family misfortune, but as a scandal
over which mean people talked. Had it rested
with her, she would long ago have overlooked the
past and have opened the door to her sister-in-law.
Not that she felt any regard or interest
in Berny Iverson; her feeling for her was now,
and always would be, largely composed of that
undying unfriendliness and repugnance that the
naturally virtuous woman feels for her sister with
the <i>tache</i>. But Cornelia was of a younger and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
milder generation than her mother. She had not
fought hard for what she had and, like Dominick,
there was more of the sunny-tempered, soft-hearted
Con Ryan in her than of the strong and
valiant woman who had made him and given him
his place in the world.</p>

<p>In the restaurant they found a vacant table
in a corner, and Cornelia had to bottle up her
good news while Dominick pondered over the
bill of fare. She was impatient and drummed
on the table with her fingers, while her eyes
roamed about the room. Once or twice, she
bowed to people that she knew, then let her glance
pass in an uninterested survey over the bare
walls and the long line of windows that gave on
the street. The place had an austerely severe,
unadorned air. Its bleakness of naked wall and
uncovered stone floor added to the foreignness
that was contributed by the strong French accent
of the waiters, and the arrangement of a cashier&#8217;s
desk near the door, where a pleasant-faced woman
sat between a large bouquet of roses and a drowsy
gray cat.</p>

<p>The orders given and the first stages of lunch
appearing, Cornelia could at last claim her brother&#8217;s
full attention. Planting her elbows on the table
and staring at him, she said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you how awfully anxious I was to see
you, and how I was going to write to you,
didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>Dominick nodded. He was buttering a piece
of bread and showed no particular acceleration
of curiosity at this query.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, what do you suppose I was going
to write about?&#8221; asked his sister, already beginning
to show a heightened color.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t imagine. Nothing wrong with mother,
I hope?&#8221;</p>

<p>Since his marriage Cornelia had been in the
habit of communicating frequently with her
brother by letter. It was the best way of keeping
him informed of family affairs. The telephone at
the senior Ryan house was sufficiently secluded
to make it a useful medium of private communication,
but the telephone at the junior Ryan
house did not share this peculiarity, and Dominick
discouraged his sister&#8217;s using it.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, mother&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Cornelia. &#8220;And
it&#8217;s nothing wrong about anybody. Quite the
other way; it&#8217;s something about me, and it&#8217;s
something cheerful. Guess!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her brother looked up and his eye was caught
by her rosily-blushing cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, Cornie,&#8221; he said with a look of
slowly-dawning comprehension, &#8220;it really isn&#8217;t&mdash;it
really can&#8217;t be&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>The waiter here interrupted further confidence
by setting forth the lunch with many attentive
bowings and murmurings. By the time he had
presented one dish for Cornelia&#8217;s approval,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
removed it with a flourish and presented another,
her impatience broke out in an imploring,</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Etienne, it&#8217;s all <i>perfectly</i> lovely. <i>Do</i>
put it on the table and let&#8217;s eat it. That&#8217;s what
it&#8217;s for, not to hand round and be stared at, as
if it were a diamond necklace that I was thinking
of buying.&#8221;</p>

<p>Etienne, thus appealed to, put the viands on
the table, and Dominick, deeply interested,
leaned forward and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it? Go ahead. I&#8217;m burning up
with curiosity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess,&#8221; said his sister, bending over her plate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it that you&#8217;re going to be married? Oh,
Cornie, it can&#8217;t be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why can&#8217;t it be?&#8221; looking very much
hurt. &#8220;What&#8217;s there so queer about that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, only I meant that I hadn&#8217;t heard
any rumors about it. <i>Is</i> it <i>that</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is, Dominick Ryan, and I don&#8217;t see
why you should be so surprised.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surprised! I&#8217;m more than surprised. I&#8217;m
delighted&mdash;haven&#8217;t been so pleased for years.
Who is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack Duffy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Cornie, that&#8217;s the best yet! That&#8217;s great!
It&#8217;s splendid. I wish I could kiss you, but I
can&#8217;t here in the open restaurant. Why didn&#8217;t
you tell me somewhere where we would be alone?
I&#8217;d just like to give you a good hug.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>Cornelia, who had been a little hurt at her
brother&#8217;s incredulity, was now entirely mollified
and once again became bashfully complacent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d like it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I thought
you&#8217;d think that was just about right. Any
girl would be proud of <i>him</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s one of the best fellows in the state&mdash;one
of the best anywhere. He&#8217;ll make you a
first-rate husband. You&#8217;re a lucky girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I am. You needn&#8217;t tell me. There
are not many men anywhere like Jack Duffy.
I&#8217;ve always said I wouldn&#8217;t marry the tag, rag
and bobtail other girls are satisfied with. <i>My</i>
husband was going to be a gentleman, and if
Jack&#8217;s anything, he&#8217;s that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right there. He&#8217;s one of Nature&#8217;s
gentlemen&mdash;the real kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cornelia thought this savored of condescension,
and said, rallying to the defense of her future lord,</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s all right, but he&#8217;s educated too.
He&#8217;s not one of those men who have good hearts
and noble yearnings but look like anarchists or
sewing-machine agents. Jack graduated high at
Harvard. He went there when he was only
eighteen. There&#8217;s no one&#8217;s had a better education
or done better by it. His father may have been
Irish and worked as shift boss on the Rey del
Monte, but Jack&#8217;s quite different. He&#8217;s just as
much of a gentleman as anybody in this country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cornelia&#8217;s attitude on matters of genealogy was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
modern and Californian. Ireland was far behind
her and Jack, as were also those great days in
Nevada of which her mother and Bill Cannon
spoke, as the returned Ulysses might have spoken
of the ten years before Troy. She and Jack would
eventually regard them as a period of unsophistication
and social ferment which it were wisest
to touch on lightly, and of which they would
teach their children nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then,&#8221; Cornelia went on, determined not
to slight any detail of her fiance&#8217;s worthiness,
&#8220;there&#8217;s never been anything fast or wild about
Jack. He&#8217;s always been straight. There&#8217;s been
no scandalous stories about him, as there have
about Terence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never. Terence committed all the scandals
for the family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Terence is in New York, thank Heaven!&#8221;
said Cornelia with pious fervor, &#8220;and we won&#8217;t
have to have anything to do with him or his wife
either. Even if we go to Europe, we need only
stay there a few days.&#8221;</p>

<p>The irregular career of Terence had been a
thorn in the side of the respectable Duffys, he,
some years earlier, having married his mistress,
a chorus girl in a local theater, and attempted
to force her upon the exclusive circles in which
his people moved. It was not the least galling
feature of Terence&#8217;s unconventional course that,
having doubled his fortune by successful speculations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
he had removed to New York where, after
several spirited assaults and vigorous rebuffs, his
wife had reached social heights toward which other
Californians of spotless record and irreproachable
character had clambered in vain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Dominick, &#8220;mother ought to be
satisfied with <i>this</i> marriage. It&#8217;s a good thing
one of her children is going to settle down the
way she likes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s delighted. She&#8217;s not been in such
good spirits for a long time, and she&#8217;s as interested
as I am in arranging everything. We want to
have a large house wedding; the two families and
all their connections, and all our intimate friends,
and all the people who&#8217;ve entertained us,&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;the
whole crowd. Of course, it&#8217;ll be a lot
of people. Mommer said she didn&#8217;t see how we
could cut it down to less than five or six hundred.
But I don&#8217;t see why we need to, the house is big
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty,&#8221; said Dominick. He set down his
knife and fork and looked at his sister. &#8220;Our
family don&#8217;t take up much room. There&#8217;s just
three of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re coming?&#8221; she said quickly, her
anxiety flashing out into an almost pained
intensity of eagerness. &#8220;You&#8217;ll come? You
must, Dominick. You&#8217;ve got to give me away.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked away from her in moody discomfort.
The eternal discussions created by his marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
were becoming more and more hateful to him.
Why should his unloved and unloving wife
perpetually stand between him and his own
people&mdash;his mother and sister&mdash;women to whom
he owed allegiance, even as he did to her? The
call of his home and the binding ties of kin were
growing stronger as the obligation of his marriage
had weakened and lost its hold.</p>

<p>Cornelia leaned across the table and spoke with
low-toned, almost tremulous earnestness:</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that if it were I, I&#8217;d ask your
wife. You know that all the hard feelings I may
once have had against her have gone. If it were
for me to say, I&#8217;d have received her from the
start. What I&#8217;ve always said is, &#8216;What&#8217;s the
good of keeping up these fights? No one gets
anything by them. They don&#8217;t do any one any
good.&#8217; But you know mommer. The first thing
she said when we talked about the house wedding,
and I said you&#8217;d give me away, was, &#8216;If he&#8217;ll
come without his wife.&#8217; Those were her very
words, and you know when she says a thing she
means it. And, Dominick, you <i>will</i> come?
You&#8217;re the only brother I&#8217;ve got. You&#8217;re the
only man representative of the family. You
can&#8217;t turn me down on my wedding day.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were tears in her eyes and Dominick saw
them and looked down at his plate.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll come.
When is it to be?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>&#8220;Oh, Dominick,&#8221; his sister breathed in an
ecstasy of relief and gratitude. &#8220;I knew you
would. And I&#8217;ll do anything for you I can. If
mommer wouldn&#8217;t get so dreadfully angry, I&#8217;d
call on your wife, but you know I can&#8217;t offend
her. She&#8217;s my mother, and I can&#8217;t stand up
against her. But some day I&#8217;ll pay you back&mdash;I
will indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right, Cornie,&#8221; he said, turning
to summon the waiter. &#8220;I can&#8217;t let my sister
get married without me. Tell mother I&#8217;ll come.
You haven&#8217;t yet told me when it&#8217;s to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;June,&#8221; said the prospective bride, once more
beginning to blush and beam, &#8220;early in June.
The roses are so fine then, and we can have the
house so beautifully decorated. We&#8217;ve already
begun to plan the trousseau. It&#8217;s going to be
just stunning, I tell you; the dresses from New
York and all the lingerie and things like that from
Paris. Mommer says she&#8217;ll give me fifteen
thousand dollars for it. And she&#8217;s going to give
me, besides, a string of pearls that hangs down
to here&#8221;&mdash;Cornelia indicated a point on her
person with a proud finger&mdash;&#8220;or else a house and
lot anywhere in town that I like. Which would
you take?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dominick was saved from the responsibility of
stating a preference on this important point by
Etienne, the waiter, presenting his hat to him
with the low bow of the well-tipped gar&ccedil;on.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
With a scraping of chair legs, they rose and,
threading their way among the now crowded
tables, passed out into the wind-swept streets.
Here they separated, Cornelia, with her armful
of wilting flowers, going home, and Dominick
back to the bank.</p>

<p>He was entering the building when he met Bill
Cannon, also returning to his office from a restaurant
lunch at a small Montgomery Street chop-house,
where, every day at one, he drank a glass
of milk and ate a sandwich. The Bonanza King
stopped and spoke to the young man, his greeting
marked by a simple friendliness. Their conversation
lasted a few minutes, and then Dominick
entered the bank.</p>

<p>Two hours later, while he was still bending
over his books, in the hushed seclusion of the
closed building, Bill Cannon was talking to Berny
in the parlor of the Sacramento Street flat. This
interview was neither so long, and (on Berny&#8217;s
part) did not show the self-restraint which had
marked the first one. The offer of one hundred
thousand dollars which the old man made her
was refused with more scorn and less courtesy
than had been displayed in her manner on the
former occasion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />


<small>A CUT AND A CONFESSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Berny was extremely unsettled. She had never
been in such a condition of worry and indecision.
She was at once depressed and elated, triumphant
and cast down, all in a bubble of excitement and
uncertainty. A combination of violent feelings,
hostile to one another, had possession of her and
used her as a battle-ground for shattering
encounters.</p>

<p>She loved money with the full power of her
nature&mdash;it was her strongest, her predominating
passion&mdash;and now for the first time in her life it
was within her grasp. She could at any moment
become possessed of a fortune, undisputedly her
own, to do with as she liked. She lay awake at
night thinking of it. She made calculations on
bits of paper as she footed up the bills at her
desk.</p>

<p>But then on the other hand, there was Dominick,
Dominick suddenly become valuable. He was
like a piece of jewelry held in slight esteem as a
trifling imitation and suddenly discovered to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
real and of rich worth. Insignificant and strange
are the happenings which determine the course of
events. The sage had told her that one more
inch in the length of Cleopatra&#8217;s nose would have
altered the face of the world and changed the
course of history. Had Berny not gone to the
park on that Sunday afternoon, and seen a
woman&#8217;s face change color at the sight of her
husband, she might have come to terms with Mrs.
Ryan and now have been on her way to Chicago
in the first stage of the plan of desertion.</p>

<p>It was another woman&#8217;s wanting Dominick
that made Berny more determined to cling to
him than if he had been the Prince Charming of
her dreams. She carried about with her a continual
feeling of self-congratulation that she had
discovered the full significance of the plot in
time. Her attitude was that of the quarreling
husband and wife who fight furiously for the
possession of a child for which neither cares.
To herself she kept saying, &#8220;They want my husband,
do they? Well, I&#8217;ll take mighty good care,
no matter how much they want him and he wants
to go, they don&#8217;t get him.&#8221;</p>

<p>It made her boil with rage to think of them all,
with Dominick at their head, getting everything
they wanted and sending her off to Paris, even
though Paris might be delightful, and she have
a great deal better time there than she ever had
in San Francisco.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>All these thoughts were in her mind as she
walked down town one afternoon for her usual
diversion of shopping and promenading. Of late
she had not been sleeping well and the fear that
this would react upon her looks had spurred her
to the unwonted exertion of walking. The route
she had chosen was one of those thoroughfares
which radiate from Market Street, and though not
yet slums, are far removed from the calm, wide
gentility of the city&#8217;s more dignified highways.
With all her cleverness, she had never shaken off
the tastes and instincts of the class she had come
from. She felt more at home in this noisy byway,
where children played on the pavements and
there were the house-to-house intimacies, the
lack of privacy, of the little town, than she did on
the big, clean-swept streets where the houses
presented a blank exterior to the gaze, and most
of the people were transported in cars or carriages.
Even the fact that the Tenderloin was
in close proximity did not modify her interest
with a counteracting disgust; though she was not
one of the women who have a lively curiosity
as to that dark side of life, it did not, on the
other hand, particularly repel her. She viewed
it with the same practical utilitarianism with
which she regarded her own virtue. That possession
had been precious to her for what she
could gain with it. When she had sacrificed it
to her ambition, she had not liked giving it up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
at all, but had reconciled herself to doing so
because of the importance of the stake involved.</p>

<p>Walking loiteringly forward she crossed Powell
Street, and approached the entrance of that
home of vaudeville, the Granada Theater. This
was a place of amusement that she much
favored, and of which she was a frequent patron.
Dominick did not like it, so she generally went
to the matin&eacute;e with one of her sisters. There
had been a recent change of bill, and as she drew
near she looked over the posters standing by the
entrance on which the program for the coming
week was printed in large letters. Midway down
one of these, her eye was caught by a name and
she paused and stood reading the words:</p>

<p class="center">
&#8220;JAMES DEFAY BUFORD<br />
<i>The Witty, Brilliant and Incomparable</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Monologist</span><br />
<i>In His Unrivaled Monologue<br />
Entitled</i><br />
KLONDIKE MEMORIES&#8221;</p>

<p>She remembered at once that this was the actor
Dominick had spoken of as having been snowed
in with them at Antelope. Dominick had evidently
not expected he would come to San Francisco.
He had said the man had been going to
act in Sacramento. After standing for some
moments looking at the words, she moved on
again with the short, mincing step that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
habitual to her, and which always made walking
a slow and undesirable mode of progression.
She seemed more thoughtful than she had been
before she saw the program, and for some blocks
her face wore an absent and somewhat pensive
air of musing.</p>

<p>Her preoccupation lasted up Grant Avenue
and down Post Street till it was finally dispelled
by the sight of that attractive show-window in
which a large dry-goods establishment exhibits
the marvels of new millinery. It was April, and
the spring fashions were just in from Paris, filling
the window with a brilliant display of the newest
revolutionary modes of which San Francisco had
so far only heard. Women stood staring, some
dismayed at the introduction of styles which they
felt would have a blighting, not to say obliterating
effect on their own beauty. Others, of
practical inclinations, studied the new gowns with
an eye to discoveries whereby their wardrobes
might be induced to assume a deceptive air of
second youth.</p>

<p>Berny elbowed her way in among them and
pressed herself close to the glass, exploring, with
a strained glance, the intricacies of back draperies
turned from view. She wished Hazel was there
with her. Hazel was wonderfully sharp at seeing
how things were put together, and could carry
complications of trimming and design in her head
without forgetting them or getting them mixed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
The discovery that skirts were being cut in a
new way gave Berny a shock of painful surprise,
especially when she thought of her raspberry crape,
still sufficiently new to be kept in its own box
between layers of tissue paper, and yet at the
stage when the necessity of paying for it was
at a comfortable, unvexing distance.</p>

<p>She was standing with her back to the street
when a woman next her gave a low exclamation
and uttered the name of Mrs. Con Ryan. Berny
wheeled about just as the exceedingly smart
victoria of Mrs. Cornelius Ryan drew up at the
curb and that august matron prepared to descend
from it. In these afternoon shopping excursions
she had often met her mother-in-law, often met
her and invariably seen her turn her head and fix
her eyes in the opposite direction. Now, however,
matters were on another footing. If Mrs.
Ryan had not recognized Berny, or spoken to her,
or received her, she had at least opened negotiations
with her, negotiations which presupposed
a knowledge of her existence if not a desire for
her acquaintance. Berny did not go so far as to
anticipate a verbal greeting, but she thought, in
consideration of recent developments, she was
warranted in expecting a bow.</p>

<p>She moved forward almost in Mrs. Ryan&#8217;s path,
paused, and then looked at the large figure moving
toward her with a certain massive stateliness.
This time Mrs. Ryan did not turn her head away.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
Instead, she looked at the young woman directly
and steadily, looked at her full in the eye with her
own face void of all recognition, impassive and
stonily unmoved as the marble mask of a statue.
Berny, her half-made bow checked as if by magic,
her face deeply flushed, walked on. She moved
down the street rapidly, her head held high,
trembling with indignation.</p>

<p>Such are the strange, unaccountable contradictions
of the female character that she felt more
incensed by this cut than by any previous affront
or slight the elder woman had offered her. The
anticipated bow, neither thought of nor hoped for
till she had seen Mrs. Ryan alighting from the
carriage, was suddenly a factor of paramount
importance in the struggle between the two.
So small a matter as a nod of the elder woman&#8217;s
head would have made the younger woman more
pliable, more tractable and easily managed, than
almost any other action on her mother-in-law&#8217;s
part. Berny, bowed to, would have been a more
docile, reasonable person than either Mrs. Ryan
or Bill Cannon had had yet to deal with; while
Berny, cut, flamed up into a blaze of mutinous
fury that, had they known it, would have planted
dismay in the breasts of those bold conspirators.</p>

<p>As she walked down the street she was at first
too angry to know where she was going, but after
a few moments of rapid progress she saw that
she was approaching the car line which passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
close to her old home. In the excitement of her
wrath, the thought of her sisters&mdash;the only
human beings who could be relied on unquestioningly
and ungrudgingly to offer her sympathy&mdash;came
to her with a sense of consolation and relief.
A clock in a window showed her it was nearly
five. Hannah would have been home for some
time, and Hazel might be expected within an
hour. Without more thought she hailed an
up-town car.</p>

<p>As the car whisked her up the long hill from
Kearney Street she thought what she would say
to her sisters. Several times of late she had
contemplated letting them into the secrets&mdash;or
some of the secrets&mdash;of her married life and
its present complications. She wanted their
sympathy, for they were the only people she knew
who were interested in her through affection, and
did not blame her when she did things that were
wrong. She also wanted to surprise them and to
impress them. She wanted to see their eyes
grow round, and their faces more and more
startled, as she told of what Mrs. Ryan was
trying to do, and how the sum of one hundred
thousand dollars was hers&mdash;their sister&#8217;s&mdash;when
she chose to take it. They were good people, the
best people for her to tell it to. They did not
know too much. They could be relied upon for
a blind, uninquiring loyalty, and she could now
(as she had before) tell them, not all&mdash;just enough&mdash;suppressing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
as women do, those facts in the
story which it were best for her to keep to herself.</p>

<p>She found them both at home, Hazel having
been allowed to leave her work an hour earlier
than usual. Sitting in a small room in the back
of the house, they were surrounded by the outward
signs of dressmaking. Yards of material lay
over the chairs, and on a small wooden table,
which fitted close to her body and upon which
portions of the material lay neatly smoothed out,
Hannah was cutting with a large pair of shears.</p>

<p>Hazel sat near by trimming a hat, a wide, flat
leghorn, round which she twined a wreath of
brier roses. Black velvet bows held the wreath
in place, and Hazel skewered these down with
long black pins, several of which she held in her
mouth. Berny knew of old this outburst of
millinery activity which always marked the month
of April. It was the semi-annual rehabilitation
of Pearl&#8217;s wardrobe, and was a ceremonial to
which all the females of the family were supposed
to contribute. In her own day she herself had
given time and thought to it. She had even been
in sympathy with the idea of the family&#8217;s rise and
increase of distinction through Pearl, who was
going to be many steps farther up the social ladder
than her mother and her aunt, if those devoted
women could possibly accomplish it.</p>

<p>Now, watching her sisters bent over their tasks
after the heat and burden of their own day&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
work, she felt a deep, heartfelt sense of gratitude
that she had escaped from this humble, domestic
sphere in which they seemed so content. Whether
Pearl&#8217;s summer hat should be trimmed with pink
or blue had once been a question which she had
thought worthy of serious consideration. How
far she had traveled from the world of her childhood
could not have been more plainly shown
her than by the complete indifference she now
felt to Pearl, her hat, and its trimmings.</p>

<p>She had come prepared to surprise her sisters,
and to shake out of them, by her revelations, the
amazed and shocked sympathy she felt would
ease her of her present wrath and pain. She
was too overwrought to be diplomatic or to
approach the point by preparatory gradations.
Thrown back in the one arm-chair in the room,
her head so pressed against its back that her hat
was thrust forward over her forehead, she told
them of her meeting with Mrs. Ryan, and the
cut which she had received.</p>

<p>Neither Hannah nor Hazel expressed the outraged
astonishment at this insult that Berny had
anticipated. In fact, they took it with a tranquillity
which savored of indifference. For the
moment, she forgot that they knew nothing of
her reason for expecting Mrs. Ryan to recognize
her, and to her quivering indignation was added
a last wounding sense of disappointment. The
sight of Hazel, holding the leghorn hat off at arm&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
length and studying it with a preoccupied, narrowed
eye, was even more irritating than her
remark, made mumblingly because of the pins
in her mouth:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you should feel so bad about
that. I should think you&#8217;d have got sort of used
to it by this time. She&#8217;s been cutting you for
over two years now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that makes it any better?&#8221;
said Berny in a belligerent tone, not moving her
head, but shifting her eyes to stare angrily at
Hazel from under her projecting hat-brim. &#8220;Do
you think you&#8217;d get used to it if Josh&#8217;s mother
cut you on the street?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was hard to compass the idea of Josh&#8217;s
deceased parent, who had left behind her a
memory of almost unique meekness, cutting anybody.
It made Hazel laugh and she had to bend
her head down and take the pins out of her
mouth before she could answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if she&#8217;d been doing it for over two
years, I think I&#8217;d have got sort of broken to it
by now,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What makes you so mad
about it all of a sudden?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe things aren&#8217;t just the same as they&#8217;ve
been for the last two years,&#8221; said Berny darkly.
&#8220;Maybe there&#8217;s a reason for Mrs. Ryan&#8217;s bowing
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>These words had the effect that the victim of
the cut desired. Her sisters paused in their work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
and looked at her. There had been times lately
when Hannah had felt uneasy about Berny&#8217;s
fine marriage, and she now eyed the younger
woman with sober intentness over the glasses
pushed down toward the tip of her nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reason?&#8221; said Hazel. &#8220;What reason? Have
you and she been trying to make up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether you&#8217;d call it that or
not,&#8221; said Berny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have things really changed between you and
her, Berny?&#8221; she asked gravely.</p>

<p>Hannah put down the shears and laid her hands
on the table. She felt the coming revelations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes, I guess you&#8217;d say they have,&#8221; said
Berny slowly, letting every word make its impression.
&#8220;She&#8217;s trying to buy me off to leave
Dominick. I suppose you&#8217;d call that a change.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Berny wanted to surprise her sisters, she
certainly now had the satisfaction of realizing
her hopes. For a moment they stared at her,
too amazed to speak, even Hannah, who had
scented difficulties, being completely unprepared&mdash;after
the way of human nature&mdash;for the particular
difficulty that had cropped up. It was
Hazel who first spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buy you off to leave Dominick? Give you
money to go away from him, do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I said,&#8221; returned her sister with
dry grimness. &#8220;She&#8217;s made me two offers to
leave my husband, wants me to get out and, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
I&#8217;ve gone for a year, ask him to bring suit for
desertion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My Lord!&#8221; murmured Hannah in a hushed
voice of horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that beats anything I&#8217;ve ever heard!&#8221;
exclaimed Hazel. &#8220;That beats the ball, and not
speaking to you, and all the rest. It&#8217;s the worst
yet! What&#8217;s made her do it? What&#8217;s the matter
with her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same thing that&#8217;s always been the matter
with her&mdash;she doesn&#8217;t like me, she wants to get
rid of me. She tried to freeze me out first by
not speaking to me, and leaving us to scramble
along the best way we could on Dominick&#8217;s salary.
Now, she&#8217;s seen that that won&#8217;t work, and she&#8217;s
gone off on a new tack. She&#8217;s a woman of resources.
If she finds the way blocked in one direction, she
tries another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s actually offered you money to leave
Dominick?&#8221; asked Hannah. &#8220;Said she&#8217;d give it
to you if you&#8217;d desert him and let him get a
divorce?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; returned her sister, in the same
hard tone, tapping with her finger-tips on the
arms of the chair. &#8220;That&#8217;s the flattering offer
she&#8217;s made me twice now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much did she offer you?&#8221; said Hazel.</p>

<p>This was a crucial question. Berny knew its
importance and sat up, pushing back her disarranged
hat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>&#8220;One hundred thousand dollars,&#8221; she said
calmly.</p>

<p>There was a second pause which seemed charged
with astonishment, as with electrical forces. The
sisters, their hands fallen in their laps, fastened
their eyes on the speaker in a stare of glassy
amaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;A hundred thousand dollars!&#8221; gasped Hazel.
&#8220;Why&mdash;why&mdash;Berny!&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped, almost trembling in the excitement
of her stunned incredulity.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>A hundred thousand dollars!</i>&#8221; Hannah echoed,
each word pronounced with slow, aghast unbelief.
&#8220;Oh, it <i>can&#8217;t</i> be that much!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that much now,&#8221; said Berny, her calmness
accentuated to the point of nonchalance, &#8220;and
if I want I can make them double it, raise it to
a quarter of a million. Two hundred and fifty
thousand dollars isn&#8217;t so much when you&#8217;ve got
millions in trunks. What&#8217;s that to the Ryans?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at her sisters with a cool, dispassionate
glance, feeling that it had been worth while
to tell them. Hannah&#8217;s face was a pale, uninteresting
mask of shocked surprise&mdash;the kind of
face with which one would imagine Hannah&#8217;s
greeting such intelligence. But through the
astonishment of Hazel&#8217;s a close and intimate
understanding of the possibilities of the situation,
an eagerness of rising respect for it and for the
recipient of such honors, was discernible and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
appealed to Berny&#8217;s vanity and assuaged her
more uncomfortable sensations.</p>

<p>&#8220;You could get a quarter of a million?&#8221; Hazel
persisted. &#8220;How do you know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny looked at her with disdain which was
softened by a slight, indulgent smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, if they want it bad enough to offer
one hundred thousand, they want it bad
enough to offer two. The money is nothing to
them, and I&#8217;m a good deal. I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised
if I could get more.&#8221; She thought of Bill
Cannon&#8217;s participation in the matter, and let an
expression of sly, knowing mysteriousness cross
her face. But Bill Cannon&#8217;s participation was a
fact she did not intend to mention. He was a
part of the story that she had decided to suppress.</p>

<p>&#8220;But two hundred and fifty thousand dollars!&#8221;
said Hazel. &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s a fortune! The interest
on it alone would make you rich. You could go
to Europe. You could have a house on Pacific
Avenue. Just fancy! And three years ago you
were working for twenty a week in the Merchants
and Mechanics Trust Company. Do you remember
when they agreed to give you that you thought
you were on velvet? Twenty dollars a week!
That looks pretty small now, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she doesn&#8217;t intend to take it, Hazel
McCrae!&#8221; said Hannah in a deep voice of shocked
disapproval. &#8220;You talk as if she was going to
accept their outrageous offer.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>Hazel&#8217;s face, which, as her fancy ranged over
these attractive possibilities, had shown varying
stages of flushed and exhilarated excitement, now
suddenly fell. Conscious that she had exhibited
a condition of mind that was low and sordid, she
hastily sought to obliterate the effect of her
words by saying sharply,</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I knew she wasn&#8217;t going to accept.
I never had such an idea. I&#8217;d be the first one to
turn it down. I was just thinking what she
<i>could</i> do if she <i>did</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s any amount of things I could do,&#8221;
said Berny. &#8220;They want me to go abroad and
live there. That was&#8221;&mdash;she was going to say
&#8220;one of the conditions,&#8221; but this, too, she
decided to suppress, and said instead&mdash;&#8220;one of
the things they suggested. They told me the
income of the money would go twice as far there.
Then the year while I was deserting Dominick&mdash;I
was to go to Chicago, or New York, and desert
him that way&mdash;I&#8217;d have seven thousand dollars
for my expenses. They weren&#8217;t mean about it,
I&#8217;ll say that much for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then laying it all out like that!&#8221; said
Hannah. &#8220;It&#8217;s just the most scandalous thing
I&#8217;ve ever heard of. I&#8217;ve never had much opinion
of Mrs. Ryan, but I really didn&#8217;t believe she&#8217;d go
that far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Dominick?&#8221; said Hazel suddenly; &#8220;what
about Dominick? What did he say?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>The matter of Dominick was the difficult part
of the revelation. Berny felt the necessity of a
certain amount of dissembling, and it helped to
chill the excitement and heat that had carried
her up to her sisters and on to this point. Dominick&#8217;s
part of the story was one of the subjects
upon which she had decided to let her remarks
be as notes about the text, and expurgated notes
at that. Now, she realized it was a complicated
matter of which to tell only half, and looking on
the floor pricked the carpet with the tip of her
parasol, and tried to maintain her tone of airy
indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dominick doesn&#8217;t know anything about it,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;He&#8217;s never to know. They were
pretty decided on that point. He&#8217;s to be
deserted without his own knowledge or consent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But to take his wife away from him!&#8221; Hannah
cried. &#8220;To rob him of her! They must be crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dominick can get along all right without me,&#8221;
said Dominick&#8217;s wife, looking at the tip of her
parasol as she prodded the carpet.</p>

<p>Hazel, the married sister, heard something in
these words that the spinster did not recognize.
A newly-wakened intelligence, startled and suspicious,
dawned on her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dominick&#8217;s not so dead in love with me,&#8221;
continued Berny, with her eyes following the
parasol tip. &#8220;He could manage to bear his life
without me. He&mdash;&#8221; she paused, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
said, enraged to hear that her voice was husky&mdash;&#8220;doesn&#8217;t
care a button whether I live or die.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pause that greeted this statement was
entirely different from its predecessors. There
was amazement in it, and there was pain.
Neither listener could for a moment speak; then
Hannah said with a solemnity full of dignity,</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that, Berny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t if you don&#8217;t want to,&#8221; returned
Berny, still not looking up. &#8220;If you like to keep
on believing lies, it&#8217;s all the same to me. But I
guess I know more about Dominick Ryan, and
what he feels, than you do, and I tell you he
doesn&#8217;t care a hang for me. He gave up caring&#8221;&mdash;she
paused, a memory of the ball, the quarrel,
and the fatal visit to Antelope flashing through
her mind&mdash;&#8220;over a year ago. I guess,&#8221; she
raised her head and looked coolly at her sisters,
&#8220;he won&#8217;t lay awake nights at the thought of
losing me.&#8221;</p>

<p>They looked at her without speaking, their
faces curiously different in expression from what
they had been after her first confessions. All
excitement had gone from them. They looked
more wounded and hurt than she did. They
were women, dashed and mortified, by a piece of
news that had abashed them in its admitted
failure and humiliation of another woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;can&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; faltered Hannah.
&#8220;Dominick&#8217;s always so kind, so attentive, so&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>She came to a stop, checked by an illuminating
memory of the Sundays on which Dominick now
never came to dinner, of his absence from their
excursions to the park, of his mysterious mid-winter
holiday to the Sierra.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you had a row?&#8221; said Hazel. &#8220;Everybody
has them some time and then you make
up again, and it&#8217;s just the same as it was before.
Fighting with your husband&#8217;s different from other
fighting. It doesn&#8217;t matter much, or last.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny looked down at the parasol tip. Her
lips suddenly began to quiver, and tears, the rare
burning tears of her kind, pricked into her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t lived together for over eight
months,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>The silence that greeted this remark was the
heaviest of all the silences.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell us before?&#8221; said Hazel,
in a low, awed voice.</p>

<p>For a moment, Berny could not answer. She
was ashamed and angry at the unexpected emotion
which made it impossible for her to command
her voice, and made things shine before her eyes,
brokenly, as through crystal. She was afraid
her sisters would think she was fond of Dominick,
or would guess the real source of the trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid something was wrong,&#8221; said
Hannah, mechanically picking up the shears, her
face pale and furrowed with new anxieties.</p>

<p>The concern in her tone soothed Berny. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
something not only to have astonished her family,
but to have disturbed their peace by a forced
participation in her woes. It had been enraging
to think of them light-heartedly going their way
while she struggled under such a load of care.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was all right till last autumn,&#8221; she said
in a stifled voice, &#8220;and then it all got wrong&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;now
it&#8217;s all gone to pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what made Dominick change?&#8221; said
Hazel, with avid, anxious eagerness. &#8220;Everything
was happy and peaceful a year ago. What
got hold of him to change him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny felt that she had told enough. It had
been harder telling, too, than she had imagined.
The last and greatest secret that she had determined
to keep from her sisters was that of Dominick&#8217;s
love for another woman&mdash;what she regarded
as his transfer of affection, not yet having guessed
that his heart had never been hers. Now she
raised her head and looked at the two solemn-faced
women, angrily and bitterly, through the
tears that her eyes still held.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, and I don&#8217;t care what&#8217;s changed
him,&#8221; she said defiantly. &#8220;I stood by my side
of the bargain, and that&#8217;s all I know. I&#8217;ve made
him a good wife, as good a one as I knew how.
I&#8217;ve been bright and pleasant when his family
treated me like dirt. I&#8217;ve not complained and
I&#8217;ve made the best of it, staying indoors and
going nowhere, when any other woman would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
been getting some sort of fun out of her life.
I&#8217;ve managed that miserable little flat on not half
enough money, and tried to keep out of debt,
when any one else in the world would have run
up bills all over for Mrs. Ryan to pay. Nobody
can say I haven&#8217;t done my part all right. Maybe
I&#8217;ve got my faults&mdash;most of us have&mdash;but I
haven&#8217;t neglected my duty this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose abruptly from her seat, pushing it
back and feeling that she had better go before
she said too much. She realized that in her
hysterical and overwrought state she might
become too loquacious and afterward regret
it. For the moment she believed all she said.
Her sisters, full of sincere sympathy for her,
believed it too, though in periods of cooler reflection
they would probably question some of her
grievances; notably that one as to the small
income, three thousand a year, representing to
them complete comfort, not to say affluence.</p>

<p>As she rose, Hazel rose too, her face full of
suspicious concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not another woman, is it, Berny?&#8221; she
almost whispered.</p>

<p>Berny had told so many lies that she did not
bother about a few more. Moreover, she was
determined not to let her sisters know about
Rose Cannon&mdash;not yet, anyway.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said with short scorn, turning to
pick up her feather boa. &#8220;Of course it&#8217;s not.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
He&#8217;s not that kind of a man. He&#8217;s too much of
a sissy. Another woman! I&#8217;d like to tell him
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a sardonic laugh and turned to the
glass, disposing her boa becomingly and adjusting
her hat. Hannah, shaking herself loose from the
encircling embrace of the cutting table, rose too,
exclaiming,</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go yet. You must tell us more of
this. I&#8217;ve not heard anything for years that&#8217;s
upset me so. If Dominick&#8217;s not in love with
somebody else, what&#8217;s got into him? Why
doesn&#8217;t he care for you any more? A man doesn&#8217;t
stop loving his wife for no cause whatever. It
isn&#8217;t in human nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s in Dominick&#8217;s nature,&#8221; said Dominick&#8217;s
wife, pulling on her gloves. &#8220;Maybe that
isn&#8217;t human nature, but it&#8217;s the nature of the
man I&#8217;m married to and that&#8217;s all that concerns
me. Remember, you&#8217;re not to say a word about
this. It&#8217;s all a secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should we talk about it?&#8221; said the
practical Hazel. &#8220;It&#8217;s bad enough to have had
it happen. You don&#8217;t want to go round gossiping
about a member of your family getting thrown
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>To their pressing invitations to remain longer,
Berny was deaf. She had said her say and
wanted to go. The interview had undoubtedly
eased her of some of the choking exasperation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
that had followed Mrs. Ryan&#8217;s cut; and it was a
source of comfort to think that she had now
broken the ice and could continue to come and
pour out her wrongs and sorrows into the ever-attentive
ears of her sisters. But now she wanted
to get away from them, from their penetrative
questions, and their frank curiosity, the curiosity
of normal, healthy-minded women, whose lives
had lacked the change and color of which hers
had been full. She cut her good-bys short and
left them to their own distracted speculations,
staring blankly at each other, amid the scattered
millinery of the disordered room.</p>

<p>When she reached home, she found on the hall
table a note which the Chinaman told her had
been left by a messenger. It was from Bill
Cannon and contained but a few lines. These,
of a businesslike brevity, expressed the writer&#8217;s
desire to see her again, and politely suggested
that, if she could come to his office on any one
of the three specified afternoons, between the
hours of two and four, he would be deeply honored
and obliged.</p>

<p>Berny, frowning and abstracted, was standing
with the note in her hand when Dominick opened
the hall door and came up the stairs. His eye
casually fell on the square of paper, but he asked
no question about it, hardly seemed to see it.
Yet her state of suspicion was so sensitively active
that his lack of interest seemed fraught with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
meaning, and pushing the letter back into its
envelope she remarked that it was a note from
her dressmaker. Even the fact that his answer
was an indifferent, barely-articulated sound
seemed significant to her, and she took the letter
into her bedroom and hid it in her handkerchief
box, as though her husband, instead of being the
least, was the most curious and jealous of men.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<small>BUFORD&#8217;S GOOD LUCK</small></h2>
</div>

<p>In his &#8220;Klondike Monologue&#8221; at the Orpheum,
Buford, the actor, made a sudden and unexpected
hit. The morning after his first appearance,
both Dominick and Berny read in the paper
eulogistic notices of the new star. Dominick
was particularly interested. He remembered
Buford&#8217;s state of worry while at Antelope and
was glad to see that the unlucky player was, in
the parlance of his own world, &#8220;making good.&#8221;</p>

<p>The evening papers contained more laudatory
paragraphs. Buford&#8217;s act was spoken of with an
enthusiasm which taxed the vocabulary of the
writers who found that the phrases they had
been using to describe the regular vaudeville performances
were not adequate for so sparkling an
occasion.</p>

<p>It was a rambling monologue of mining-camp
anecdotes, recollections, and experiences, delivered
with confidential, simple seriousness. Buford&#8217;s
appearance in an immense, fur-lined overcoat
with buttons made of gold nuggets and a voluminous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
fur cap on his head, was given the last
touch of grotesqueness by a tiny tinsel spangle
fastened on the end of his nose. This adornment,
on his entrance hardly noticeable, was
soon the focusing point of every eye. It looked
as if it grew on its prominent perch, and as he
spoke, a slight, vibrating movement, which he
imparted to that portion of his visage, made the
tinsel send out continuous, uneasy gleams. The
more serious his discourse was and the more
portentously solemn his face, the more glimmeringly
active was the spangle, and the more hysterically
unrestrained became the laughter of the
audience. Altogether, Buford had made a success.
Three days after his first appearance, people
were talking about &#8220;The Klondike Monologue&#8221;
as a few weeks before they had been talking about
the last play of Pinero&#8217;s as presented by a New
York company.</p>

<p>From what Buford had told him, Dominick
knew that the actor&#8217;s luck had been bad, and
that the period of imprisonment at Antelope was
a last, crowning misfortune. Through it he feared
that he had forfeited his Sacramento engagement,
and the young man had a painful memory
of the long jeremiad that Buford, in his anxiety
and affliction, had poured out to himself and
Rose Cannon. That the actor was evidently
emerging from his ill fortune was gratifying to
Dominick, who, in the close propinquity forced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
upon them by the restricted quarters of Perley&#8217;s
Hotel, had grown to like and pity the kindly,
foolish and impractical man.</p>

<p>Now, from what he heard, Buford&#8217;s hard times
should be at an end. Such a hit as he had made
should give him the required upward impetus.
Men Dominick knew, who had theatrical affiliations,
told him that Buford was &#8220;made.&#8221; The
actor could now command a good salary on any
of the vaudeville circuits in the country, and
if &#8220;he had it in him&#8221; he might ascend the ladder
toward the heights of legitimate comedy. His
humorous talent was unique and brilliant. It was
odd, considering his age, that it had not been
discovered sooner.</p>

<p>Berny was very anxious to see him. Hazel and
Josh had seen him on one of the first evenings and
pronounced him &#8220;simply great.&#8221; She extorted
a promise from Dominick that, at the earliest
opportunity, he would buy tickets for her, and,
if he could not accompany her himself, she could
go with one of her sisters. Dominick did not
want to go. He had no desire to see Buford
and be reminded of the three weeks&#8217; dream which
had interrupted the waking miseries of his life,
and more than that he hated, secretly and
intensely, sitting beside Berny, talking to her
and listening to her talk, during the three hours
of the performance. The horrible falseness of
it, the appearance of intimacy with a woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
toward whom he only felt a cold aversion, the
close proximity of her body which he disliked, even
accidentally, to brush against, made him shrink
from the thought as from the perpetration of
some mean and repulsive deception.</p>

<p>He stopped to buy the tickets one midday on
his way to lunch. He made up his mind to buy
three, then Berny could either take her two
sisters, or Hazel and Josh, whose craving for the
theater was an unassuageable passion. The good
seats were sold out for days ahead and he had to
be content with three orchestra chairs for an
evening at the end of the following week. He was
turning from the ticket office window when a
sonorous voice at his elbow arrested him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Ryan,&#8221; it boomed out, &#8220;do I see you
at last? Ever since my arrival in the city I
have hoped for the opportunity of renewing our
acquaintance.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Buford, but a rejuvenated and prosperous
Buford, the reflection of his good fortune shining
from his beaming face and fashionable figure.
The red rasped look had left his features and the
hollows beneath his high cheek-bones were filled
out. He was dressed in gray with an almost
foppish nicety, a fedora hat of a paler tint on his
head, and a cravat of a dull red rising in a rich
puffed effect below his collar. His shoes shone
with the glassy polish of new patent leather;
the red-brown kid gloves that he carried exhaled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
an attractive odor of russia-leather. He held
out his hand to Dominick, and the young man
grasped it with real heartiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to see you, Buford,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and glad
to hear you&#8217;ve made such a success of it. I
haven&#8217;t seen it myself, but I hear it&#8217;s a great
show.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buford, who had seen him buying the tickets,
said blandly,</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re going? You&#8217;ve been buying
tickets, haven&#8217;t you? Oh, I&#8217;ve got to have your
opinion&mdash;nobody&#8217;s I&#8217;d think more of than Mr.
Dominick Ryan&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dominick, with the consciousness that he had
just been planning not to go reddening his face,
stammered with embarrassed evasiveness,</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just been buying tickets and couldn&#8217;t
get them before the end of next week. You&#8217;re
such a confounded success that everything&#8217;s sold
out days ahead. My wife wants to see you, and
that&#8217;s the best I could do for her. Her sister
went on the second night and says you&#8217;re the hit
of the program. And then the papers! You&#8217;ll
soon be one of the stars of the nation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buford acknowledged these compliments with
cool, acquiescent complacence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have struck my gait,&#8221; he said, nodding his
head in condescending acceptance. &#8220;I have at
last won my spurs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t expect to come down here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
when you were at Antelope. Didn&#8217;t you tell me
your engagement was for two weeks in Sacramento,
and that you were afraid you&#8217;d forfeited
it by being snowed in there? How was it you
came down after all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The luck turned. The tide that comes in the
affairs of men came in mine. I must say it had
got down to about the lowest ebb. You&#8217;re right
about forfeiting my engagement. Got to Sacramento
three weeks behind time and found they&#8217;d
procured a substitute, and all I had for my pains
was a blackguarding because the Lord had seen
fit to snow me in in the Sierras.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dominick laughed, and the actor allowed a
slight, sour smile to disturb the professional
gravity of his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he nodded, &#8220;that&#8217;s the way of the
transgressor, especially when his transgressions
ain&#8217;t of his own doing. After I&#8217;d been there two
weeks, I hadn&#8217;t a V between me and starvation.
I looked for jobs with the water squelching in
my boots, and finally I had to do a turn in a
fifth-rate variety performance that showed in
a sort of cellar down a flight of stairs.
That&#8217;s where the &#8216;Klondike Monologue&#8217; was born.
Like lots of other good things, it had a pretty
mean beginning. I just pieced it together from
bits and scraps that were the tailings of the two
years I had spent in that Arctic mill up there.
It caught on from the start&mdash;let the public alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
to recognize a good thing when they see one!
That dirty cellar was pretty well sprinkled the
first week, and the second they had the standing
room signs out. I didn&#8217;t introduce the spangle
till the end of the engagement. Some people
think it a great touch.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked with sober questioning at Dominick,
who said apologetically,</p>

<p>&#8220;So I hear, but I haven&#8217;t seen it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buford raised his flexible brows with an air
of stimulated, excusing memory.</p>

<p>&#8220;True, true,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I had forgotten.
Two nights after I had introduced the spangle,
one of the &#8216;Granada&#8217; people saw me. I didn&#8217;t
know it at the time, but I am a true artist; whatever
my audience, I give it of my best, and, in
that instance, it was only one more case of bread
cast upon the waters. There&#8217;d been a vacancy
here. Estradilla, the Spanish Snake Dancer, was
taken suddenly sick, collapsed after her third
performance, tied her intestines up in a knot
with her act, they say, and the wonder was she
hadn&#8217;t done it before. Anyhow, they had to
substitute in a hurry, heard of my Klondike act
and sent a man up to see if I&#8217;d do to fill in. The
next week I was here and&mdash;you know the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They say every man has his chance. You
didn&#8217;t suppose the snowstorm that caught you
at Antelope was going to be the foundation of
yours?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>Buford raised his brows till they about touched
his hair, and said with his most magisterial sonority
of tone,</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no indeed. The ways of Fate&mdash;or let
me say Providence&mdash;are truly inscrutable. I
thought that lock-up in the Sierras would be my
undoing, and I&#8217;m sure I never imagined the two
years I spent in that accursed Arctic were going
to return to roost as blessings. I turned my
face to the North in a bitter hour, and it was in a
bitter hour that I adopted the stage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dominick was exceedingly surprised. He had
supposed Buford always to have been an actor,
to have been born to it. If he had heard that the
man had made his debut as an infant prodigy
or even in his mother&#8217;s arms in swaddling clothes,
he would have felt it was in keeping with Buford&#8217;s
character, and just what he suggested. Now,
in a tone expressing his surprise, the young man
queried,</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you went on the stage up there? You&#8217;ve
only been on a few years?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nearly four,&#8221; said the actor. He looked
down at his shoe for a moment as if considering,
and repeated without looking up, &#8220;It will be
four next September. Trouble drove me to those
far distant lands and hard luck drove me on the
stage. I&#8217;d never had anything to do with it
till then; I hadn&#8217;t a stage game about me. There&#8217;d
even been a time when I had a strong prejudice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
against the theater and never went to one. But
a man must live and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped, his attention arrested by a hand
laid softly on his sleeve. A youth of Hebraic
countenance had issued from a door behind him,
and, touching his arm with a hesitating, unclean
finger, began to speak in a low tone. Buford
turned to the boy. Dominick backed away from
them toward the box-office window. As they conferred
he took a card out of his wallet, and
hastily traced the address of the flat below
his name. He had it ready to offer Buford,
when the actor, his conference over, came toward
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Duty calls,&#8221; said Buford. &#8220;I am sorry, but
they want me inside. But this is not going to
be our only meeting. I&#8217;m booked for two weeks
longer here, and I&#8217;m hoping to see something
more of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dominick gave him the card, with assurances
that he would be glad to see him, and that his
own home was a better meeting-place than the
bank. At this mark of friendship, the actor was
openly gratified. He looked at the card with a
smile and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Most certainly I&#8217;ll avail myself of this privilege.
I hope later to be able to place a box at
your disposal. Madame, you say, is very desirous
of seeing me. Well, I&#8217;ll see to it that she does
so under the most favorable conditions. Though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
I have never met her, I think I may ask you to
convey my respects to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bowed impressively as though saluting
Berny in person, and then, with a last dignified
farewell to Dominick, turned toward the door
which opened at his approach, disclosing the
waiting Jew boy. As the actor drew near, Dominick
heard the boy break into low-toned remonstrances,
and then the door closed upon Buford&#8217;s
sonorous and patronizing notes of reproval.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />


<small>ROSE&#8217;S POINT OF VIEW</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The following Sunday, at ten o&#8217;clock in the
morning, Dominick noiselessly descended the stairs
of the flat and let himself out into the street.
He had had a sleepless night, and as he stood in
the dazzling sunshine, debating which way he
should go, his face showed the hollows and lines
left by hours of worried wakefulness.</p>

<p>His day&mdash;the holiday of his week of steady
work&mdash;was without engagement. The friend with
whom he usually walked over the suburban hills
had moved to the country. His rest from labor
would take the form of a day spent away from
his home in the open air. As he had eaten his
breakfast he had planned his itinerary, carefully
considering the best distribution of these twelve
treasured hours of liberty. He would spend the
morning walking, anywhere&mdash;the direction did not
matter much&mdash;anywhere where there was quiet
and a view. He would take his lunch at any
little joint&mdash;country hotel, city chop-house&mdash;he
happened to pass, and in the afternoon he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
walk again, on for hours, probably over the
Presidio Hills where the poppies were beginning
to gild the slopes, or along the beach where there
were unfrequented nooks in which a man could
lie and look at the water, and think. A whole
day away from Berny and the flat, in the healing
balm of the sunshine and the clean, untroubled air,
was the best way to renew the fund of philosophy
and patience that of late he had felt was almost
exhausted.</p>

<p>The ferment of his wakeful night was still in
his blood as he walked across the city, aiming for
the eminence of Telegraph Hill. He walked
slowly without looking up; his eyes on the tip
of his cane as it struck the pavement. It was a
superb day, calm, still, breathing peace, like that
other Sunday when he had gone to the park with
the Iversons and seen Rose Cannon. But the
splendors of the morning did not divert his mind
from its heavy musings. With down-drooped
head, watching the striking tip of the cane as
though in it there lay some mystic solution of
his difficulties, he walked on, a slow-moving figure,
a man wrestling with his own particular world-problem,
facing his fate and repudiating it.</p>

<p>There had been times lately when he had felt
he could no longer endure the present conditions
of his life. As he had lain thinking in the darkness
of the previous night, it had come upon him,
with the clearness of conviction, that he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
not stand it. The future with Berny had loomed
before him, crushing, unbearable, and he had seen
no end to it, and repeated to himself that he must
be free of it. It had been awful as a nightmare,
and turning on his bed he had wondered how
he had endured the situation so long.</p>

<p>Now, as he walked through the sweet, gay
morning he felt a renewal of courage and reasoned
with himself, using the old arguments with which
for two years he had been subduing his rebellion
and curbing the passion and impatience of his
youth. Because a man had married an uncongenial
woman, was that an excuse for him to
leave her, to put her away from him when she
had honestly tried to live up to her marriage
contract? Summing it all up in a sentence&mdash;his
wife had a bad temper and he had ceased to care
for her, was that a reason for him to separate
from her?</p>

<p>Last night he had used none of these arguments.
He had felt too strongly to reason about the righteousness
of moral obligation. Lying in the dark,
listening to the striking of the clocks, he had said
to himself that he could not stand Berny any longer&mdash;he
could not live in the house with her. He did
not hate her, it was far from that. He wished
her well; to hear that she was happy and prosperous
somewhere where he did not have to dine
with her and sit in the den with her every
evening, would have given him the greatest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
satisfaction. He felt that the sight of her was
daily growing more unbearably and unnaturally
obnoxious to him. Little personal traits of hers
had a strange, maddening power of exciting his
dislike. In the evening the rustling of the sheets
of the newspaper as she turned and folded them
filled him with a secret anger. He would sit
silent, pretending to read, waiting for that regular
insistent rustling, and controlling himself with an
effort. As they sat opposite each other at
breakfast, the sound she made as she crunched
the toast seemed to contain something of her
own hard, aggressive personality in it, and he
hated to hear it. In the dead depression of the
night, he had felt that to listen to that rustling
of newspapers every night and that crunching of
toast every morning was a torment he could no
longer bear.</p>

<p>In the clear light of the morning, patience had
come and the old standards of restraint and forbearance
reasserted themselves. The familiar
pains, to which he had thought himself broken,
had lost much of their midnight ghoulishness.
The old ideals of honor and obligation, with
which he had been schooling himself for two
years, came back to his mind with the unerring
directness of homing pigeons. He went over the
tale of Berny&#8217;s worthiness and his own responsibility
in the misfortunes of her life and disposition.
It was a circular process of thought that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
always returned to the starting place: what
right had he to complain of her? Had not most
of the disappointments that had soured and
spoiled her come from his doing, his fault, his
people?</p>

<p>He breathed a heavy sigh and looked up. To
this question and its humbly acquiescing answer
these reflections always brought him. But to-day
it was hard to be acquiescent. The rebellion of
the night was not all subdued. The splendor of
the morning, the pure arch of sky, the softness
of the air, called to him to rejoice in his strength,
to be glad, and young. He raised his head,
breathing in the sweet freshness, and took off his
hat, letting the sun pour its benediction on his
head. His spirit rose to meet this inspiring,
beneficent nature, not in exhilaration, but in
revolt. The thought of Rose gripped him, and in
the strength of his manhood he longed for her.</p>

<p>He ascended the hill by one of the streets on its
southern slope, violently steep, the upward leaps
of its sidewalk here and there bridged by flights
of steps. Every little house was disgorging its
inmates, garbed in the light Sunday attire of the
Californian on pleasure bent. The magnificent
day was calling them, not to prayer and the
church, but to festival. Families stood on the
sidewalks, grouped round the Sunday symbol of
worship, a picnic-basket. Lovers went by in
smiling pairs, arm linked in arm. A pagan joy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
in life was calling from every side, from the
country clothed in its robe of saffron poppies,
from the sky pledged to twelve hours of undimmed
blue, from the air mellowed to a warmth that
never burns, from the laughter of light hearts, the
smiles of lovers, the eyes of children.</p>

<p>Dominick went up the hill in the clear, golden
sunlight, and in his revolt he pushed Berny from
his mind, and let Rose come in her place. His
thoughts, always held from her, sprang at her,
encircled her, seemed to draw her toward him as
once his arms had done. She was a sacred thing,
the Madonna of his soul&#8217;s worship, but to-day she
seemed to bend down from her niche with less of
the reverenced saint than of the loving woman
in the face his fancy conjured up.</p>

<p>Standing on the summit of the hill, where the
wall of the quarry drops down to the water front
and the wharves, he relinquished himself to his
dream of her. The bay lay at his feet, a blue
floor, level between rusty, rugged hills. There
was an island in it, red-brown, incrusted with
buildings, that seemed to clutch their rocky
perch with long strips and angles of wall. In the
reach of water just below there was little shipping,
only a schooner beating its way to sea. The wind
was stiffer down there than on the sheltered side
of the hill. The schooner, with sails white as
curds against the blue, was tacking, a long,
slantwise flight across the ruffled water. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
left a thin, creamy line behind her which drifted
sidewise into eddying curves like a wind-lashed
ribbon. Dominick, his eyes absently on her,
wondered if she were bound for the South Seas,
those waters of enchantment where islands, mirrored
in motionless lagoons, lie scattered over
plains of blue.</p>

<p>A memory crossed his mind of a description of
some of these islands given him by a trader he
had once met. They were asylums, lotus-eating
lands of oblivion, for law-breakers. Those who
had stepped outside the pale, who had dared defy
the world&#8217;s standards, found in them a haven,
an elysian retreat. They rose before his mental
vision, palm-shaded, lagoon-encircled, played upon
by tropic breezes, with glassy waves sliding up a
golden beach. There man lived as his heart
dictated, a real life, a true life, not a bitter tale
of days in protesting obedience to an immutable,
heart-breaking law. There he and Rose might live,
lost to the places they had once filled, hidden
from the world and its hard judgments.</p>

<p>The thought seized upon his mind like a drug,
and he stood in a tranced stillness of fascinated
imagination, his eyes on the ship, his inner vision
seeing himself and Rose standing on the deck.
He was so held under the spell of his exquisite,
enthralling dream, that he did not see a figure
round the corner of the rough path, nor notice its
slow approach. But he felt it, when its casual,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
roaming glance fell on him. As if called, he
turned sharply and saw Rose standing a few yards
away from him, looking at him with an expression
of affrighted indecision. As his glance met hers,
the dream broke and scattered, and he seemed to
emerge out of a darkness that had in it something
beautiful and baleful, into the healthy, pure
daylight.</p>

<p>The alarm in Rose&#8217;s face died away, too. For
a moment she stood motionless, then moved
toward him slowly, with something of reluctance
about her approach. She seemed to be coming
against her will, as if obeying a summons in his
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t sure it was you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And
then when I saw it was, I was going to steal away
before you saw me. But you turned suddenly
as if you heard me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt you were there,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>It was natural that with Rose he should need
to make no further explanation. She understood
as she would always understand everything that
was closely associated with him. He would never
have to explain things to her, as he never, from
their first meeting, felt that he needed to talk
small talk or make conversation.</p>

<p>She came to a stop beside him, and they stood
for a silent moment, looking down the bare wall
of the quarry, a raw wound in the hill&#8217;s flank,
to the docks below where the masts of ships rose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
in a forest, and their lean bowsprits were thrust
over the wharves.</p>

<p>&#8220;You came just in time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I walked
up here this morning to have a think. I don&#8217;t
know where the think was going to take me when
you came round that corner and stopped it.
What brought you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing in particular. It was such a fine
morning I thought I&#8217;d just ramble about, and I
came this way without thinking. My feet brought
me without my knowledge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My think brought you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s
the second time it&#8217;s happened. It was a revolutionary
sort of think, and there was a lot about
you in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked down at her, standing by his shoulder,
and met her eyes. They were singularly pellucid,
the clearest, quietest eyes he thought he had ever
looked into. His own dropped before them to the
bay below, touched and then quickly left the
schooner which was beating its way toward them
on the return tack.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you could only always come this way when
I want you, everything would be so different,
so much easier,&#8221; he said in a low tone. &#8220;I was
surrounded by devils and they were getting tight
hold of me when you came round that corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced at her sidewise with a slight,
quizzical smile.</p>

<p>This time she did not answer his look, but with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
her eyes on the bay, her brows drawn together,
asked,</p>

<p>&#8220;New devils or old ones?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old ones, but they&#8217;ve grown bigger and
twice as hard to manage lately. They&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he
broke off, his voice suddenly roughened, and said,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t seem to know how to live my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned his face away from her. The
demons she had exorcised had left him weakened.
In the bright sunshine, with the woman he loved
beside him, he felt broken and beaten down by
the hardships of his fate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down and talk to me,&#8221; she said quietly.
&#8220;No one can hear you. It&#8217;s like being all alone
in the world up here on the hilltop. We can sit
on this stone.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a broken boulder behind them, close
to the narrow foot-way, and she sat on it, motioning
him to a flat piece of rock beside her. Her
hands were thrust deep in the pockets of her
loose gray coat, the wisps of fair hair that
escaped below the rim of her hat fanning up and
down in faint breaths of air, like delicate threads
of seaweed in ocean currents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me the whole thing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You
and I have never talked much about your affairs.
And what concerns you concerns me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pricked at the earth with the tip of his cane,
ashamed of his moment of weakness, and yet fearing
if he told her of his cares it might return.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s just what you know,&#8221; he began slowly.
&#8220;Only as every day goes by it seems to get worse.
I&#8217;ve never told you much about my marriage.
I&#8217;ve never told anybody. Many men make
mistakes in choosing a wife and find out, and
say to themselves early in the game, that
they <i>have</i> made a mistake and must abide by
it. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m weaker than they are,
but somehow&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped and looked at the moving tip of
his cane. She said nothing, and after taking a
deep breath he went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew all about her when I married her.
I was young, but I wasn&#8217;t a green fool. Only I
didn&#8217;t seem to realize, I didn&#8217;t guess, I didn&#8217;t
dream, that she was going to stay the way she
was. I seemed to be at the beginning of a sort
of experiment that I was sure was going to turn
out well. I didn&#8217;t love her, but I liked her well
enough, and I was going to try my best to have
things go smoothly and make her happy. When
she was my wife, when I&#8217;d try to make everything
as comfortable and pleasant as I could, then I
expected she&#8217;d&mdash;she&#8217;d&mdash;be more like the women
men love, and even if they don&#8217;t love, manage to
get on with. But it didn&#8217;t seem to go well even
in the beginning, and now it&#8217;s got worse and
worse. Perhaps it&#8217;s my fault. I&#8217;m not one of
those fellows who can read a woman like a book.
When a person tells me a thing, I think they mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
it; I&#8217;m not looking into them to see if they mean
just the opposite.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped again and struck lightly at a lump
of earth with his cane. He had pushed his hat
back from his forehead and his face bore an
expression of affected, boyish nonchalance which
was extremely pathetic to Rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe there are men who could stand it all
right. She&#8217;s very nice part of the time. She&#8217;s
a first-class housekeeper. I give her two hundred
dollars a month, and on that little bit she
runs the flat beautifully. And she&#8217;s quiet. She
doesn&#8217;t want to be out all the time, the way some
women do. She&#8217;s as domestic as possible, and
she&#8217;s been very decent and pleasant since I came
back. The way she was treated over the ball
would have r&#8217;iled any woman. I didn&#8217;t tell you
about that&mdash;it&#8217;s a mean story&mdash;but she got no
invitation and was angry and flared up. We had
a sort of an uncomfortable interview, and&mdash;and&mdash;that
was the reason I went to Antelope. I didn&#8217;t
think I&#8217;d ever go back to her then. I was pretty
sore over it. But&mdash;&#8221; he paused, knocking the
lump of clay into dust, &#8220;I thought afterward it
was the right thing to do. I&#8217;d married her, you
see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose did not speak, and after a moment he
said in a low voice,</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s&mdash;awfully hard to live with a
person you don&#8217;t get on with. And it&#8217;s the sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
of thing that goes on and on and on. There
isn&#8217;t any end; there isn&#8217;t any way out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more he stopped, this time clearing his
throat. He cleared it twice, and then said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I oughtn&#8217;t to say this. I oughtn&#8217;t to complain.
I know I&#8217;m a chump and a coward to talk
this way to you, but&mdash;&#8221; he dropped his voice to a
note of low, inward communing, and said, &#8220;it&#8217;s
so hopeless. I can&#8217;t see what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned forward and rested his forehead on
the head of his cane, hiding his face from her.
The silence between them vibrated with the huskiness
of his voice, the man&#8217;s voice, the voice of
power and protection, roughened with the pain
he was unused to and did not know how to bear.</p>

<p>Rose sat looking at him, her soul wrung with
sympathy. Her instinct was to take the bowed
head in her arms and clasp it to her bosom, not
as a woman in love, but as a woman torn by pity
for a suffering she could not alleviate. She made
no movement, however, but kept both hands
deep in her pockets, as she said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you shouldn&#8217;t talk this way
to me. I think I&#8217;m the one person in the world
that you ought to speak to about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t talk to anybody else, not to any friend,
not to my own mother. It&#8217;s my affair. No one
else had any responsibility in it. I brought it on
myself and I&#8217;ve got to stand by it myself. But
you&mdash;you&#8217;re different.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>He drew himself up, and, staring out into the
great wash of sun and air before him, went on in
a louder voice, as if taking a new start.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking last night about it, looking it
in the face. The dark&#8217;s the best time for that,
you seem to see things clearer, more truthfully.
And I came to the conclusion it would be better
if I ended it. I didn&#8217;t see that I had any obligation
to go on martyrizing myself for ever. I
didn&#8217;t see that anybody was benefiting by it.
I thought we&#8217;d be happier and make something
better of our lives if we were apart, in different
houses, in different towns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she want to leave you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question seemed to touch a nerve that
startled and then stiffened him. He answered it
with his head turned half toward her, the eyebrows
lifted, a combative note in his voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether she does or not.&#8221; He
stopped and then said, with his face flushing,
&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think she does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you leave her then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can&mdash;&#8221; he turned on her almost angrily
and met her clear eyes. &#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t go into particulars,&#8221;
he said sharply, looking away again.
&#8220;It&#8217;s not a thing for you and me to discuss. Incompatibility
is a recognized ground of separation.&#8221;</p>

<p>He fell to striking the lump of clay again, and
Rose said, as if offering the remark with a sort of
tentative timidity,</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>&#8220;You said just now you had nothing to complain
of against her. It doesn&#8217;t seem fair to leave
a woman&mdash;a wife&mdash;just because she&#8217;s hard to live
with and you no longer like her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you,&#8221; he said with a manner so full of
irritated disagreement as to be almost hectoring,
&#8220;advocate two people living on together in a
semblance of friendship, who are entirely uncongenial,
rub each other the wrong way so that the
sight of one is unpleasant to the other?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure that&#8217;s the way she feels about
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He again looked away from her, and answered
in a sullen tone, as though against his will,</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were silent for a space, and he went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it strike you as wrong, cowardly,
mean, for a man and woman to tear their lives to
pieces out of respect for what the world says and
thinks? Every semblance of love and mutual
interest has gone from our companionship. Isn&#8217;t
it all wrong that we should make ourselves
miserable to preserve the outward forms of it?
We&#8217;re just lying to the world because we haven&#8217;t
got the sand to tell the truth. You ask me if
my views on this matter are hers. I don&#8217;t know,
that&#8217;s the truth.&#8221; A memory of Berny&#8217;s futile
and pathetic efforts to make friends with him
on his return swept over him and forced him to
say, &#8220;Honestly, I don&#8217;t think she wants to leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
me. I think the situation doesn&#8217;t drive her
crazy the way it does me. I think she doesn&#8217;t
mind it. I don&#8217;t know why, but she doesn&#8217;t
seem to. But surely, any woman living would
rather be free of a man she no longer cared for,
than forced to live on in a false relation with him,
one irritating the other, the two of them every
day growing more antagonistic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She would not want to be free if she loved him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Loved him!&#8221; he ejaculated, with angry scorn.
&#8220;She never loved me or anybody else. Love is
not in her. Oh, you don&#8217;t know! I thought last
night I&#8217;d offer her all I had, the flat, the furniture,
my salary, everything I could rake and scrape
together, and then I&#8217;d tell her I was going to
leave her, that I couldn&#8217;t stand living that way
any longer. I was going to take a room somewhere
and give her everything I could. I was
going to be as generous to her as I knew how.
I&#8217;d not say one word against her to anybody.
That was what I thought I&#8217;d do last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this morning you think differently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because those are not your real thoughts&mdash;they&#8217;re
the dark, exaggerated ones that come when
a person lies awake at night. It&#8217;s as if, because
you couldn&#8217;t see your surroundings, you were in
another sort of world where the proportions are
different. You couldn&#8217;t do that to your wife.
You couldn&#8217;t treat her that way. You say in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
many ways she&#8217;s been a good wife. It isn&#8217;t she
that&#8217;s stopped caring, or finds her life with you
disagreeable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, am I to suffer this way for ever&mdash;see
my life ruined for a fault man after man commits
and goes scott free?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your life isn&#8217;t ruined. Things don&#8217;t last at
such a pressure. Something will change it. By
and by, you&#8217;ll look back on this and it&#8217;ll seem
hundreds of miles away and you&#8217;ll wonder that
you were so discouraged and hopeless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said bitterly, &#8220;maybe when I&#8217;m
fifty. It&#8217;s a long time between then and now,
a long time to be patient.&#8221;</p>

<p>Manlike, he was wounded that the woman of
his heart should not side with him in everything,
even against his own conscience. Had Rose been
something closer to him, a sister, a wife, this
would have been one of the occasions on which
he would have found fault with her and accused
her of disloyalty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d understand,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I
thought you&#8217;d see how impossible it is. You make
me feel that I&#8217;m a whining coward who has come
yelping round like a kicked dog for sympathy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I care so much that I do more than sympathize,&#8221;
she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>This time he did not answer, feeling ashamed
at his petulance.</p>

<p>&#8220;With any one else it would be just sympathy,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
she said, &#8220;but with you there&#8217;s more than that.
It&#8217;s because I care, that I expect more and demand
more. Other men can do the small, cowardly,
mean things that people do, and find excuses for,
but not you. I could make excuses for them too,
but I must never have to make excuses for you.
You&#8217;re better than that, you&#8217;re yourself, and you
do what&#8217;s true to yourself and stand on that.
You&#8217;ve got to do and be the best. Maybe it won&#8217;t
be what you want or what&#8217;s most comfortable,
but that mustn&#8217;t matter to you. If you&#8217;re not
to be happy that mustn&#8217;t matter either. What
pleases you and me mustn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s not the
thing for a man like you to do. You can&#8217;t shirk
your responsibilities. You can&#8217;t stick to something
you&#8217;ve done just while it&#8217;s pleasant and
then, when it&#8217;s hard, throw it up. Lots of people
do that, thousands of them. Just as you said
now&mdash;hundreds of men do what you have done and
go scott free. That&#8217;s for them to do if they want
to, but not for you. Let them drop down if they
want, that&#8217;s no reason why you should. Let them
go on living any way that&#8217;s agreeable to them,
<i>you</i> know what you ought to do and you must do
it. It doesn&#8217;t matter about them, or the world, or
what anybody says. The only thing that matters
is that the thing you know in your heart is the
thing that&#8217;s true for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You expect too much of weak human nature,&#8221;
he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I don&#8217;t. I only expect
what you can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m to live for the rest of my life with a
wife I don&#8217;t care for, separated from the woman
I love? What is there in that to keep a man&#8217;s
heart alive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The knowledge that we love each other.
That&#8217;s a good deal, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the first time she had said in words
that she loved him. There was no trace of
embarrassment or consciousness on her face;
instead she seemed singularly calm and steadfast,
much less moved than he. Her words shook him
to the soul. He turned his eyes from her face
and grasping for her hand, clasped it, and pressed
it to his heart, and to his lips, then loosed it and
rose to his feet, saying, as if to himself,</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s a good deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was silence between them for some
minutes, neither moving, both looking out at the
hills and water. From the city below, sounds of
church bells came up, mellow and tranquil,
ringing lazily and without effort. Other sounds
mingled with them, refined and made delicate by
distance. It was like being on an island floating
in the air above the town. Rose got up and
shook the dust from her coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;The churches are coming out, it must be nearly
one. It will be lunch-time before I get home.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>He did not turn or answer, but stood with his
hand on the metal rope that protected the
quarry&#8217;s ledge, looking down. Her eyes followed
his, and then brought up on the schooner bearing
away on its long tack, strained and careening in
the breeze that, down there in the open, blew
fresh and strong from the great Pacific.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a schooner,&#8221; she said absently. &#8220;Where
do you suppose it&#8217;s going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Somewhere a long way off,
I hope. My devils are sailing away on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stood side by side, gazing down at it till
she moved away with a sudden &#8220;Good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; he answered, and stretched out
his hand.</p>

<p>But she was already some feet in advance and
had begun to move quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by, Rose,&#8221; he cried after her, with
something in his voice of the wistful urgency in
a child&#8217;s when it is left behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; she called over her shoulder
without looking back. &#8220;Good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>He followed her with his eyes till she disappeared
round the bend of the path, then turned
back and again dropped his glance to the schooner.</p>

<p>He stood watching it till it passed out of
sight beneath the shoulder of the hill, straining
and striving like a wild, free creature in its forward
rush for the sea.</p>

<small>THE LITTLE SPIDER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Berny had been turning over in her mind the
advantages of accepting the money&mdash;had been
letting herself dwell upon the delights of possible
possession&mdash;when at the Sunday dinner that
afternoon Josh McCrae threw her back into the
state of incensed rejection with which she had
met the first offer. With his face wreathed in
joyous grins, he had apprised her of the fact that
only an hour earlier, while walking on Telegraph
Hill, he had seen Dominick there talking with
Miss Cannon.</p>

<p>A good deal of query followed Josh&#8217;s statement.
There was quite an outburst of animated interrogations
rising from the curiosity the Iversons
felt concerning Bill Cannon&#8217;s daughter, and under
cover of it Berny controlled her face and managed
to throw in a question or two on her own account.
There had been a minute&mdash;that one when Josh&#8217;s
statement had struck with a shocking unexpectedness
on her consciousness&mdash;when she had felt and
looked her wrath and amaze. Then she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
gripped her glass and drunk some water and,
swallowing gulpingly, had heard her sister&#8217;s rapid
fire of questions, and Josh, proud to have imparted
such interesting information, answering importantly.
Putting down her glass, she said quite
naturally,</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you say you saw them&mdash;near the
quarry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just by the edge, talking together. I was
going to walk along and join them, and then I
thought they looked so sort of sociable, I&#8217;d better
not butt in. Dominick got to know her real well
up in the Sierra, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course,&#8221; she said hurriedly. &#8220;They
grew to be quite friends. They must have met
by accident on the hill. Dominick&#8217;s always
walking in those queer, deserted places.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t got acquainted with her yet,
have you?&#8221; said the simple Josh, whose touch
was not of the lightest. &#8220;It would be a sort of
grind on the Ryans if you get really solid with
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I can know her whenever I want,&#8221; Berny
answered airily, above a discomfort of growing
revelation that was almost as sharp as a pain.
&#8220;Dominick&#8217;s several times asked me if I wanted
to meet her, but it always was at times when
I&#8217;d other things to do. We&#8217;re going to ask her
to the flat to tea some time.&#8221;</p>

<p>On ordinary occasions, Berny would never have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>
gone to this length of romantic invention, for she
was a judicious liar and believed, with the sage,
that a lie was too valuable a thing to waste. But
just now she was too upset, too preyed upon by
shock and suspicion, to exercise an artistic
restraint, and she lied recklessly, unmindful of a
future when her listeners would expect to see her
drafts on the bank of truth cashed.</p>

<p>She was quiet for the rest of the afternoon, but
it was not till she had reached her own home,
silent in its untenanted desertion, that she had
an opportunity to turn the full vigor of her mind
on what she had heard.</p>

<p>She had been jealous of Rose since that fatal
Sunday when she had discovered why Dominick
was changed. It was not the jealousy of disprized
love, it was not the jealousy of thwarted
passion. It was a subtle compound of many ingredients,
the main one a sense of bursting indignation
that two people&mdash;one of them a possession of
her own&mdash;should dare to seek for happiness where
she had found only dullness and disappointment.
She had an enraging premonition that Rose would
probably succeed where she had failed. It made
her not only jealous of Rose, it made her hate
her.</p>

<p>Josh&#8217;s words increased this, and caused her
suspicions, which, if not sleeping, had of late been
dormant, to wake into excited activity. Dominick&#8217;s
lonely Sunday walks she now saw shared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
by the girl who was trying to buy his freedom.
Incidents that before she had taken at their face
value now were suddenly fraught with disturbing
significance. Why did Dominick go out so often
in the evening? Since the moonlight night, he
had been out twice, once not coming back till
eleven. The confirmation of sight could hardly
have made her more confident that he must
spend these stolen hours with Rose Cannon in
the palatial residence on Nob Hill. And it was
not the most soothing feature in the case that
Berny should picture them in one of the artistically-furnished
parlors of which she had heard
so much and seen nothing but the linings of the
window curtains. Here, amid glories of upholstery,
from the sight of which she was for ever
debarred, Rose and Dominick talked of the
time when he should be free. Berny, like the
tiger lashing itself to fury with its own tail,
thought of what they said, till she became sure
her imaginings were facts; and the more she
imagined, the more enraged and convinced she
became.</p>

<p>She put from her mind all intention of ever
taking the money. She wanted it desperately,
terribly; she wanted it so much that when she
thought of it it made her feel sick, but the joys
of its possession were at the unrealizable distance
of dreams, while the fact of her husband&#8217;s being
enticed away by another woman was a thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
of close, immediate concern, a matter of the
moment, as if some one were trying to pick her
pocket. As an appurtenance of hers, Dominick
might not have been a source of happiness, but
that was no reason why he should be a source of
happiness to some one else.</p>

<p>Berny did not argue with any such compact
clearness. She was less lucid, less defined and
formulated in her ideas and desires than she had
been when Bill Cannon made the first offer.
Anger had thickened and obscured her clarity
of vision. Suspicions, harbored and stimulated by
a mind which wished for confirmation of the most
extravagant, had destroyed the firm and well-outlined
conception of what she wanted and was
willing to fight for. In fact, she had passed the
stage in the controversy when she was formidable
because she stood with the strength of sincerity
in her position, her demands, and refusals. Now
the integrity of her defiance was gone. She wanted
the money. She wanted to take it, and her
refusal to do so was false to herself and to her
standards.</p>

<p>She knew that the interview for which Bill
Cannon had asked was for a last, deciding conversation.
He was to make his final offer. It
was a moment of torture to her when she wondered
what it would be, and her mind hovered in
distracted temptation over the certain two hundred
thousand dollars and the possible quarter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
of a million. It was then that she whipped up
her wrath, obscured for the moment by the
mounting dizziness of cupidity, and thought of
Rose and Dominick in the Japanese room, or
the Turkish room, or the Persian room, into
which she had never been admitted. The thought
that they were making love received a last, corrosive
bitterness from the fact that Berny could
not see the beautiful and expensive surroundings
of these sentimental passages.</p>

<p>She was in this state of feverish distractedness
when she went to Bill Cannon&#8217;s office. She had
chosen the last of the three days he had specified
in his note, and had left the flat at the time he
had mentioned as the latest hour at which he
would be there. She had chosen the last day as
a manner of indicating her languid interest in
the matter to be discussed, and had also decided
to be about fifteen minutes late, as it looked more
indifferent, less eager. Bill Cannon would never
know that she was dressed and ready half an
hour before she started, and had lounged about
the flat, watching the clocks, and starting at
every unrecognized sound.</p>

<p>She was received with a flattering deference.
As her footstep sounded on the sill of the outer
office, a face was advanced toward one of the
circular openings in the long partition, immediately
disappeared, and then a door was thrown back to
admit to her presence a good-looking, well-dressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
young man. His manner was all deferential
politeness. A murmur of her name, just touched
with the delicately-questioning quality imparted
by the faintest of rising inflections, accompanied
his welcoming bow. Mr. Cannon was expecting
her in the private office. Special instructions had
been left that she should be at once admitted.
Would she be kind enough to step this way?</p>

<p>Berny followed him down the long strip of
outer office where it flanked the partition in
which the regularly-recurring holes afforded
glimpses of smooth bent heads. She walked
lightly, and had an alert, wary air as though it
might be a good thing to be prepared for an
ambush. She had been rehearsing her part of
the interview for days; and like other artists,
now that the moment of her appearance was at
hand, felt extremely nervous, and had a sense
of girding herself up against unforeseen movements
on the part of the foe.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, could have been more disarmingly
friendly than the old man&#8217;s greeting.
As the door opened and the clerk pronounced her
name, he rose from his seat and welcomed her in
a manner which was a subtle compound of simple
cordiality and a sort of masonic, unexpressed
understanding, as between two comrades bound
together by a common interest. Sitting opposite
him in one of the big leather chairs, she could not
but feel some of her resentment melting away,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
and her stiffly-antagonistic pose losing something
of its rigidity as he smiled indulgently on her,
asking about herself, about Dominick, finally
about her sisters, with whose names and positions
he appeared flatteringly familiar.</p>

<p>Berny answered him cautiously. She made a
grip at her receding anger, conscious that she
needed all her sense of wrong to hold her own
against this crafty enemy. Even when he told
her he had heard with admiration and wonder of
Hannah&#8217;s fine record in the primary school
department, her smile was guarded, her answer
one of brief and watchful reserve. She wished
he would get to the point of the interview. Her
mind could not comfortably contain two subjects
at once, and it was crammed and running over
with the all-important one of the money. Her
eyes, fixed on him, did not stray to the furnishings
of the room or the long windows that reached to
the ceiling and through the dimmed panes of
which men on the other side of the alley stood
looking curiously down on her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, when he had disposed of
Hannah&#8217;s worthiness and even celebrated the
merits of Josh in a sentence of appreciation, &#8220;it&#8217;s
something to have such a good sterling set of
relations. They&#8217;re what make the &#8216;good families&#8217;
in our new West out here. And they&#8217;re
beginning to understand that in Europe. When
they see your people in Paris, they&#8217;ll recognize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
them as the right kind of Americans. The
French ain&#8217;t as effete as you&#8217;d think from what
you hear. They know the real from the imitation
every time. They&#8217;ve had their fill of Coal Oil
Johnnys and spectacular spenders. What they&#8217;re
looking for is the strong man and woman who
have carved out their own path.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny&#8217;s eyes snapped into an even closer
concentration of attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe that&#8217;s so,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t
see when my sisters are ever going to get to Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll go over to see you,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;I guess I could manage now and then to get &#8217;em
passes across the continent.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rested one elbow on the desk against which
he was sitting, and with his hand caressing his
short, stubby beard, he looked at Berny with eyes
of twinkling good nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to think of it,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I guess I
could manage the transportation across the ocean,
too. It oughtn&#8217;t to cost &#8217;em, all told, more&#8217;n
fifty dollars. It seems hard luck that Miss
Hannah, after a lifetime of work, shouldn&#8217;t see
Paris, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you think I&#8217;m going to be there?&#8221;
said Berny sharply. She found any deviation
from the subject in hand extremely irritating, and
her manner and voice showed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course you are,&#8221; he said, with a little
impatient, deprecating jerk of his head. &#8220;You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
can&#8217;t be going to persist in a policy that&#8217;s simply
cutting your own throat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I rather fancy I am,&#8221; she answered in a cool,
hard tone. To lend emphasis to her words, she
unbent from her upright attitude and leaned
against the chair-back in a sudden assumption of
indifference. Her eyes, meeting his, were full of
languid insolence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel that I&#8217;ll go to Paris at all,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I think little old San Francisco&#8217;s good
enough for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked away from her at the papers on the
desk, eyed them for a thoughtful moment, and
then said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you were as short-sighted as
that. I&#8217;ll tell you fair and square that up to
this I&#8217;ve thought you were a pretty smart
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess from this on, you&#8217;ll have to put
me down a fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed, a short, sardonic laugh, and her
adversary smiled politely in somewhat absent
response. With his eyes still on the papers, he
said,</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no&mdash;I can&#8217;t agree to that. Short-sighted
is the word. You&#8217;re not looking into the future,
you&#8217;re not calculating on your own powers of
endurance. How much longer do you think you
can stand this battle with your husband and the
Ryans?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>In the dead watches of the night, Berny had
asked herself this question, and found no answer
to it. She tried to laugh again, but it was harder
and less mirthful than before.</p>

<p>The old man leaned forward, shaking an admonitory
forefinger at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know, young woman, that&#8217;s a
pretty wearing situation? Don&#8217;t you know to
live in a state of perpetual strife will break down
the strongest spirit? The dropping of water will
wear away a stone. You <i>can&#8217;t</i> stand the state
of siege and warfare you&#8217;ve got yourself into
much longer. Your rage is carrying you along
now. You&#8217;re mad as a whole hive full of hornets
and the heat of it&#8217;s keeping you going, furnishing
fuel to the engines, so to speak. But you
can&#8217;t keep up such a clip. You&#8217;ll break to pieces
and you&#8217;ll break suddenly. Then what&#8217;ll happen?
Why, the Ryans&#8217;ll come with a big broom and
sweep the pieces out. They won&#8217;t leave one little
scrap behind. That flat on Sacramento Street will
be swept as clean of you as if you&#8217;d never had
your dresses hanging in the cupboard or your
toothbrush on the wash-stand. Old Delia&#8217;s a
great housekeeper. When she gets going with a
broom there&#8217;s not a speck escapes her.&#8221;</p>

<p>His narrowed eyes looked into hers with that
boring steadiness that she was beginning to
know. He was not smiling now, rather he looked
a man who knew he was talking of very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
momentous things and wanted his companion to
know it too.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all talk,&#8221; Berny snapped. &#8220;If that&#8217;s
all you&#8217;ve got to say to me, I&#8217;d better be going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; he stretched out an opened hand and
with it made a down-pressing gesture that was
full of command. &#8220;Don&#8217;t move yet. These are
just suggestions of mine, suggestions I was making
for your good. Of course, if you don&#8217;t care to
follow them, it&#8217;s your affair, not mine. I&#8217;ve done
my duty, and, after all, that&#8217;s what concerns me
most. What I asked you to come here for to-day
was to talk about this matter, to talk further,
to thresh it out some more. I&#8217;ve seen Mrs. Ryan
since our last meeting.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, and Berny sat upright, her eyes on
him in a fixity of listening that was almost a glare.
She was tremulously anxious and yet afraid to
hear the coming words.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did she say?&#8221; she asked with the same
irritation she had shown before.</p>

<p>&#8220;She doubles her offer to you. She&#8217;ll give you
two hundred thousand dollars to leave her son.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Berny, drawing herself
to the edge of the chair. &#8220;She can keep her
two hundred thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That two hundred thousand dollars, well
invested, would give an income of from twelve to
fifteen thousand a year. On that, in Paris, you&#8217;d
be a rich woman.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll stay a poor one in San Francisco.&#8221;</p>

<p>He eyed her ponderingly over the hand that
stroked his beard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;what&#8217;s making
you act like this? You stump me. Here you
are, poor, treated like dirt, ostracized as if you
were a leper, with the most powerful family in
California your open enemy, and you won&#8217;t take
a fortune that&#8217;s offered you without a condition,
and go to a place where you&#8217;d be honored and
courted and could make yourself anything you&#8217;d
like. I can&#8217;t make it out. You beat me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny was flattered. Even through the almost
sickening sense of longing that the thought of the
lost two hundred thousand dollars created in her,
she was conscious of the gratified conceit of the
woman who is successfully mysterious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother your head about it,&#8221; she said
as lightly as she could. &#8220;Think I&#8217;m crazy, if
that makes it any easier for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think <i>that</i>,&#8221; he answered, conveying
in the accented monosyllable his inability to think
lightly of her mental equipment. &#8220;There&#8217;s something
underneath it all I don&#8217;t know. You&#8217;ve
not been quite open, quite as open as I think <i>my</i>
frankness deserves. But, of course, a man can&#8217;t
force a lady&#8217;s confidence. If you don&#8217;t want to
give me yours, I&#8217;ve got to be content without it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny emitted a vague sound of agreement.
She once more drew herself to the edge of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
chair, taking the renewed, arranging grip of
departure on her purse. She wanted to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said with the cheerful lengthening
of the word, which is the precursor of the preliminary
sentence of farewell, &#8220;I guess&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; but
he stopped her again with the outspread, authoritative
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be in such a hurry; I&#8217;ve not finished yet.
There&#8217;s more to be said, and it&#8217;s worth losing a
few moments over.&#8221; His face was so much more
commanding than his words that she made no
attempt to move, though each minute deepened
her desire to leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is just between you and me,&#8221; he went
on slowly, his voice lowered, dropped to the key
of confidences. &#8220;It&#8217;s a little matter between us
that no one else needs to know anything about.
My part of it just comes from the fact that I
want to do a good turn not only to Delia Ryan,
but to you. I&#8217;m sorry for you, young woman,
and I think you&#8217;re up against it. Now, here&#8217;s
my proposition; I&#8217;ll add something to that money
myself. I&#8217;ll give you another hundred thousand.
I&#8217;ll put it with Mrs. Ryan&#8217;s pile, and it&#8217;ll run
your fortune up well past a quarter of a million.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes fixed upon her were hard in his
benevolently-smiling face.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think about it?&#8221; he asked, as
she was speechless. &#8220;Three hundred thousand
dollars in a lump&#8217;s a goodish bit of money.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>Berny felt dizzy. As her rancor had seemed
slipping from her in the earlier part of the
interview, now she felt as if her resolution was
suddenly melting. She was confused between
the strangling up-rush of greed and the passion
that once again rose in her against the old man,
who showed such a bold determination to sweep
her from his daughter&#8217;s path. She was no longer
mistress of herself. Inward excitement, the
unfamiliar struggle with temptation, had upset
and unnerved her. But she did not yet know it,
and she answered slowly, with a sort of sullenness,
that might have passed as the heaviness of
indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want to give it to me for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m sorry for you. Because I want
you to get out of this hole you&#8217;re in, and go and
make something of your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before she knew it, Berny said low, but with
a biting incisiveness,</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you liar!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cannon was surprised. He looked for a staring
moment at her pale face, stiff over its strained
muscles, and said in a tone of cheerful amaze,</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, what do you mean by that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I say,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You&#8217;re a liar
and you know it. Every word you&#8217;ve said to
me&#8217;s been a lie. Why, Mrs. Ryan&#8217;s better than
you. She don&#8217;t come covering me with oily
stories about wanting me to be happy. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
think that I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re offering me
this money. Well, old man, I do. You want to
get my husband for your own daughter, Rose
Cannon.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Cannon&#8217;s turn to be speechless. He
had not for years received so unexpected and
violent a blow. He sat in the same attitude, not
moving or uttering a sound, and looking at Berny
with a pair of eyes that each second grew colder
and more steely. Berny, drawn to the edge
of her chair, leaned toward him, speaking with
the stinging quickness of an angry wasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;You thought I didn&#8217;t know it. Well, I do.
I know the whole thing. I&#8217;ve just sat back and
watched you two old thieves thinking everything
was hidden, like a pair of ostriches. And you
being so free with your glad hand and being
sorry for me and wanting me to make the most
of my life! You said I was a smart woman.
Well, I&#8217;m evidently a lot smarter than you thought
I was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it seems,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Smart enough to do
some very neat inventing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Inventing!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I wish there was
some inventing about it. <i>I</i> don&#8217;t take any pleasure
in thinking that another woman&#8217;s trying to
buy my husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>He dropped his hand from his chin, and moved
a little impatiently in his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said with sudden authority, &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
can&#8217;t waste my time this way. Are you going
to take the money or not?&#8221;</p>

<p>His manner, as if by magic, had changed.
Every suggestion of deference, or consideration
had gone from it. The respect, with which he had
been careful to treat her, had suddenly vanished;
there was something subtly brutal in his tone,
in the very movement of impatience he made.
It was as if the real man were at last showing
himself.</p>

<p>She uttered a furious phrase of denial and sprang
to her feet. His manner was the last unbearable
touch on the sore helplessness of her futile rage.
His chair had been standing sidewise toward
the desk, and now, with a jerk of his body, he
swept it back into position.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then go!&#8221; he said, without looking
at her.</p>

<p>Berny had intended going, rushing out of the
place. Now at these words of dismissal, flung
at her as a bone to a dog, she suddenly was rooted
to the spot. All her reason, balance, and common
sense were swept away in the flood of her quivering,
blind anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will <i>not</i> go,&#8221; she cried, at the pitch of folly,
&#8220;I will <i>not</i> till I&#8217;m good and ready. Who are
you to order me out? Who are you to tell me
what I&#8217;m to do? A man who tries to buy another
woman&#8217;s husband for his daughter, and then
pretends he and she are such a sweet, innocent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
pair! Wouldn&#8217;t people be surprised if they knew
that Miss Rose Cannon wanted my husband, was
getting her father to make bids for him, and was
meeting him every Sunday!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; thundered the old man, bringing his
open hand down on the table with a bang.</p>

<p>The tone of his voice was bull-like, and the
blow of his hand so violent that the fittings of
the heavy desk rattled. Berny, though not
frightened, was startled and drew back. For a
moment she thought he was going to rise and
forcibly put her out. Then she looked sidewise
and saw two men at a window on the other side
of the alley gazing interestedly down at them.
Cannon was conscious of the observers at the
same time. He restrained the impulse to spring
to his feet which had made her shrink, and rose
slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;you don&#8217;t
seem to understand that this interview&#8217;s at an
end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said with a stubborn shake of her
head, &#8220;I&#8217;m not through yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing more for you to say unless
you want to accept Mrs. Ryan&#8217;s offer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there is, there&#8217;s lots more for me to say,
but since you seem in such a hurry to get rid
of me, I&#8217;ll have to wait and say it to your daughter
next time I see her.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused, daring and impudently bold. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
was a woman of remarkable physical courage,
and the old man&#8217;s aspect, which might have
affrighted a less audacious spirit, had no terrors
for her. He stood by the desk, his hands on his
hips, the fingers turned toward his back, and his
face, the chin drawn in, fronting her with a
glowering fixity of menace.</p>

<p>&#8220;When do <i>you</i> ever see my daughter?&#8221; he
asked, the accented pronoun pregnant with scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, on the streets, in the stores, walking round
town. I often meet her. I&#8217;ve wanted several
times lately to stop and tell her what I think of
the way she&#8217;s acting. She doesn&#8217;t think that I
know all about what she&#8217;s doing. She&#8217;ll be surprised
when she hears that I do and what <i>I</i>
think about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She faced the old man&#8217;s motionless visage with
an almost debonair audacity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can offer me money,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but you
can&#8217;t muzzle me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cannon, without changing his attitude, replied,</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do a good many things you don&#8217;t think
of. Take my advice, young woman, and muzzle
yourself. Don&#8217;t leave it for me to do. I&#8217;ve had
nothing but friendly feelings for you up to this,
and I&#8217;d hate to have you see what a damned ugly
enemy I can be.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave his head a nod, dropped his hands and
turned from her. As he moved, a small spider
that had been hidden among the papers on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
desk started to scuttle over the yellow blotting
pad. It caught his eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look there,&#8221; he said, indicating it, &#8220;that
little spider thinks it can have things all its own
way on my desk. But&mdash;&#8221; and he laid his great
thumb on it, crushing it to a black smudge&mdash;&#8220;that&#8217;s
what happens to it. Now, Mrs. Dominick
Ryan, that&#8217;s not the first little spider that&#8217;s come
to grief trying to run amuck through my affairs.
And it don&#8217;t seem, as things look now, as if it was
going to be the last. It&#8217;s not a healthy thing for
little spiders to think they can run Bill Cannon.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rubbed his soiled thumb on the edge of the
blotter, and Berny looked at the stain that had
been the spider.</p>

<p>&#8220;Best not butt into places where little spiders
are not wanted,&#8221; he said, and then looking at her
sidewise, &#8220;Well, is it good-by?&#8221;</p>

<p>Something in the complete obliteration of the
adventurous insect&mdash;or the words that had accompanied
its execution&mdash;chilled Berny. She was not
frightened, nor less determined, but the first
ardor of her defiance was as though a cold breath
had blown on it. Still she did not intend to
leave, ignominiously withdrawing before defeat.
She wanted to say more, rub it in that she knew
the reason for his action, and let him see still
plainer in how slight esteem she held his daughter.
But the interlude of the spider had been such a
check that she did not know exactly how to begin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
again. She stood for a moment uncertain, and
he said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you take the money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; she said loudly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me that
again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he answered quietly, &#8220;that ends
our business. Do you know your way out, or
shall I ring for Granger to see you to the door?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a bell on the desk and he extended his
hand toward it. She guessed that Granger was the
polished and deferential young man who had
greeted her on her entrance, and the ignominy of
being escorted out under a cloud&mdash;literally shown
the door by the same youth, probably no longer polished
or deferential, was more than she could bear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going,&#8221; she said fiercely. &#8220;Don&#8217;t dare
to touch that bell! But just be sure of one thing,
Bill Cannon, this is not the last you or your
daughter will hear of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bowed with an air of irony that was so
slight it might not have been noticed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any messages from you will be received by
me with pleasure. But when it comes to other
things&#8221;&mdash;her hand was on the door-knob but
she had to listen&mdash;&#8220;remember the little spider.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rats!&#8221; she said furiously, and tore open the
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good afternoon, Mrs. Ryan,&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Good afternoon!&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not answer, but even in her excitement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
was conscious that the clerks behind the partition
might be listening, and so shut the door, not with
the bang her state of mind made natural, but
with a soft, ladylike gentleness. Then she walked,
with a tapping of little heels and a rustle of
silken linings, down the long, narrow office and
out into the street.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />


<small>THE LION&#8217;S WHELP</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was late, almost dark, that evening when
Cannon left his office. He had sat on after
Berny&#8217;s departure, sunk in a reverie, which was
not compounded of those gentle thoughts that
are usually associated with that state of being.
In the past, when he had been struggling up from
poverty, he had had his fierce fights, and his
mortifying defeats. He had risen from them
tougher and more combative than ever, filled with
the lust of vengeance which in the course of time
was assuaged. But of late years few (and these
antagonists of his own measure) had had the
temerity to cross swords with him.</p>

<p>Now he had been defied in his stronghold and
by the sort of person that he looked upon as a
worm in the path&mdash;the kind of worm a man did
not even tread on but simply brushed aside. It
was incredible in its audacity, its bold insolence.
As he walked down Montgomery Street to the
car, he pondered on Berny, wonderingly and with
a sort of begrudging, astonished admission of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
courage that he could not but admire. What a
nerve the woman had to dare to threaten him!
To threaten Bill Cannon! There was something
wild, uncanny, preposterous in it that was almost
sublime, had the large, elemental quality of a
lofty indifference to danger, that seemed to belong
more to heroic legend than to modern life in the
West. But his admiration was tempered by his
alarm at the thought of his daughter&#8217;s learning of
the sordid intrigue. The bare idea of Rose&#8217;s censuring
him&mdash;and he knew she would if she ever
learned of his part in the plot&mdash;was enough to
make him decide that some particularly heavy
punishment would be meted out to the woman
who dared shatter the only ideal of him known
to exist.</p>

<p>But he did not for a moment believe that Berny
would tell. She was angry and was talking
blusteringly, as angry women talk. He did not
know why she was in such a state of ill temper,
but at this stage of the proceedings he did not
bother his head about that. For the third time
she had refused the money&mdash;that was the only
thing that concerned him. If she refused three
hundred thousand dollars, she would refuse
anything. It was as much to her as a million
would be. She would know it was as large a
sum as she could expect. If that would not buy
her, nothing would. Her threats were nonsense,
bluff and bluster; the important thing was, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
had determined, for some reason of her own, to
stick to Dominick Ryan.</p>

<p>How she had found out about Rose he could
not imagine, only it was very enraging that she
should have done so. It was the last, and most
detestable fact in the whole disagreeable business.
Brooding on the subject as the car swept him up
the hill, he decided that she had guessed it. She
was as sharp as a needle and she had put this
and that together, the way women do, and had
guessed the rest. Pure ugliness might be actuating
her present line of conduct, and that state
of mind was rarely of long duration. The jealous
passions of women soon burn themselves out.
Those shallow vessels could not long contain feelings
of such a fiery potency, especially when harboring
the feeling was so inconvenient and expensive.
No one knew better than Berny how well worth
her while it would be to cultivate a sweet reasonableness.
This was the only gleam of hope left.
Her power to endure the present conditions of
her life might give out.</p>

<p>That was all the consolation the Bonanza King
could extract from the situation, and it did not
greatly mitigate his uneasiness and bad humor.
This latter condition of being had other matter
to feed it, matter which in the interview of the
afternoon had been pushed into the background,
but which now once again obtruded itself upon
his attention. It was the first of May. By the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
morning&#8217;s mail he had received a letter from
Gene announcing, with the playful blitheness
which marked all the young man&#8217;s allusions to
the transfer of the Santa Trinidad Ranch, that
the year of probation was up and he would
shortly arrive in San Francisco to claim his own.</p>

<p>Gene&#8217;s father had read this missive in grim-visaged
silence. The sense of self-approval that
he might have experienced was not his; he only
felt that he had been &#8220;done&#8221;. Two months
before, thinking that the ranch was slipping too
easily from his grasp, that he was making too
little effort to retain his own, he had hired a
detective to go to San Luis Obispo and watch
the career of Gene for signs of his old waywardness.
On the thirtieth of April the man had reported
that Gene&#8217;s course had been marked by an
abstinence as genuine and complete as the most
exacting father could wish.</p>

<p>The old man crumpled up the letter and threw
it into the waste-paper basket, muttering balefully,
like a cloud charged with thunder. It was not
that he wished Gene to drink again; it was that
he hated most bitterly giving him the finest piece
of ranch land in California. It was not that he
did not wish his son to be prosperous and respectable,
only he wished that this happy condition
had been achieved at some one else&#8217;s expense.</p>

<p>His mood was unusually black when he entered
the house. The servant, who came forward to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
help him off with his coat, knew it the moment he
saw the heavy, scowling face. The piece of intelligence
the man had to convey&mdash;that Mr. Gene Cannon
had arrived half an hour earlier from San Luis
Obispo&mdash;was not calculated to abate the Bonanza
King&#8217;s irritation. He received it with the expressionless
grunt he reserved for displeasing information,
and, without further comment or inquiry,
went up the stairs to his own rooms. From these
he did not emerge till dinner was announced,
when he greeted Gene with a bovine glance of
inspection and the briefest sentence of welcome.</p>

<p>Gene, however, was not at all abashed by any
lack of cordiality. At the best of times, he was
not a sensitive person, and as this had been his
portion since his early manhood, he was now used
to it. Moreover, to-night he was in high spirits.
In his year of exile he had learned to love the
outdoor life for which he was fitted, and had
conceived a passionate desire to own the splendid
tract of land for which he felt the love and pride
of a proprietor. Now it was his without let or
hindrance. He was the owner of a principality,
the lord of thousands of teeming acres, watered
by crystal streams and shadowed by ancient oaks.
He glowed with the joy of possession, and if
anything was needed to complete his father&#8217;s
discomfiture, it was Gene&#8217;s na&iuml;ve and bridling
triumph.</p>

<p>Always a loquacious person, a stream of talk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
flowed from him to which the old man offered no
interruption, and in which even Rose found it
difficult to insert an occasional, arresting question.
Gene had any number of new plans. His head
was fuller than it had been for years with ideas
for the improvement of his land, the development
of his irrigating system, the planting of new
orchards, the erecting of necessary buildings.
He used the possessive pronoun continually,
rolled it unctuously on his tongue with a new,
rich delight. He directed most of his conversation
toward Rose, but every now and then he
turned on his father, enthusiastically dilating on
a projected improvement certain to increase the
ranch&#8217;s revenues by many thousands per annum.</p>

<p>The old man listened without speaking, his
chin on his collar, his eyes fixed in a wide, dull
stare on his happy boy. At intervals&mdash;Gene
almost clamoring for a response&mdash;he emitted one
of those inarticulate sounds with which it was
his custom to greet information that he did not
like or the exact purport of which he did not
fathom.</p>

<p>The only thing which would have sweetened
his mood would have been a conversation, peaceful
and uninterrupted, with his daughter. He had
not seen as much of her as usual during the last
few days, as she had been confined to her room
with a cold. This was the first evening she had
been at dinner for four days, and the old man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
had looked forward to one of their slow, enjoyable
meals together, with a long, comfortable chat
over the black coffee, as was their wont. Even
if Rose did not know of his distractions and
schemes, she soothed him. <i>She</i> never, like this
chattering jackass from San Luis Obispo&mdash;and
he looked sulkily at his son&mdash;rubbed him the
wrong way. And he had hardly had a word
with her, hardly, in fact, had heard her voice during
the whole meal.</p>

<p>When it was over, and she rose from her seat,
he asked her to play on the piano in the sitting-room
near by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give us some music,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want to
hear something pleasant. The whole day I&#8217;ve
been listening to jays and knaves and fools, and
I want to hear something different that doesn&#8217;t
make me mad or make me sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose left the room and presently the sound of
her playing came softly from the sitting-room
across the hall. Neither of the men spoke for a
space, and the old man, casting a side look at
Gene, was maliciously gratified by the thought
that his son was offended. But he had reckoned
without his offspring&#8217;s amiable imperviousness
to the brutalities of the parental manner, wrought
to-night to a condition of absolute invulnerability
by the young man&#8217;s unclouded gladness. Gene,
his eyes on his coffee-cup, was in anything but a
state of insulted sullenness, as was proved by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
presently looking up and remarking, with innocent
brightness,</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t expect I&#8217;d get it, did you, Pop?
I knew from the start you were sure I&#8217;d slip up
before the year was out.&#8221;</p>

<p>His father eyed him without replying, a blank,
stony stare, before which Gene did not show the
slightest sign of quailing. He went on jubilantly
in his high, throaty voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t dead certain of it myself at the
start. You know it isn&#8217;t the easiest thing in the
world to break off drinking habits that have
had you as long as mine had me. But when I
went down there and lived right on the land,
when I used to get up in the morning and look
out of my window across the hills and see the
cattle dotted all over them, and the oaks thick
and big and bushy, and feel the air just as soft
as silk, I said to myself, &#8216;By gum, Gene Cannon,
you&#8217;ve got to have this ranch if you die for want
of whisky.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve got it!&#8221; said his father in a
loud, pugnacious tone. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got it, haven&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess I have,&#8221; said Gene, his triumph
tempered by an air of modesty, &#8220;and I guess
I earned it fair. I stuck to the bargain and there
were times when I can tell you it was a struggle.
I never once slipped up. If you don&#8217;t believe
my word, I can bring you men from down there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
that know me well, and they&#8217;ll testify that I
speak the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>The father raised his eyebrows but said nothing.
If there was anything further needed to show
him what a complete, consistent fool his son was,
it was the young man&#8217;s evident impression that
the Santa Trinidad Ranch had been relinquished
upon his own unsupported testimony. That was
just like Gene. For weeks the detective had
trotted at his heels, an entirely unsuspected
shadow.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Rose who really put me up to it,&#8221;
he went on. &#8220;She&#8217;d say to me I could do it,
I only had to try; any one could do anything they
really made their minds up to. If you said you
couldn&#8217;t do a thing, why, then you couldn&#8217;t, but
if you said you could, you got your mind into that
attitude, and it wasn&#8217;t hard any more. And she
was right. When I got my mind round to looking
at it that way, it came quite easily. Rose&#8217;s
always right.&#8221;</p>

<p>This, the first statement of his son&#8217;s to which
the Bonanza King could subscribe, did not placate
the old man. On the contrary, it still further
inflamed his sense of angry grievance. It was
bad enough to have Gene stealing the ranch&mdash;that&#8217;s
all it was&mdash;but to have him chuckling and
grinning over it, when that very day Rose&#8217;s
chances of happiness had come to a deadlock, was
just what you might expect of such a fool. Out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
of the fullness of the heart the mouth spoke,
growled rather,</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just waiting to hear you give some credit
to Rose. Here you are talking all through dinner
like a megaphone all about yourself and your
affairs, and not giving a thought to your sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gene stared at his parent in ingenuous, concerned
amaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a thought to Rose?&#8221; he repeated, in a
high, surprised key. &#8220;Oh, yes I have&mdash;lots of
thoughts. I was just telling you now about how
she braced me up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Braced you up! Of course she braced you
up. Hasn&#8217;t she been doing it all her life? But
you can&#8217;t think of anything but yourself. Don&#8217;t
you ever look at your sister and think about her
and how <i>she</i> feels?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Gene, giving his head a confirmatory
wag, &#8220;I do, I do whenever I&#8217;m in town. You
see, being away on the ranch so much&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man leaned back in his chair, emitting
a loud, interrupting groan. Gene stared at him
with a dawning uneasiness. He had begun to
grasp the fact that his father was in a state of
mind which had complications that included more
than the old familiar contemptuousness of his
every-day mood. He decided to advance more
gingerly, for even Gene&#8217;s imperviousness to snubs
did not make him proof against the Bonanza
King&#8217;s roused displeasure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; he said mildly, &#8220;no man ever
had a more unselfish sister than I have, or was
more devoted to her than I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, why the hell,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;do
you go on talking about yourself and your damned
concerns, bothering the life out of her when she&#8217;s
got troubles of her own?&#8221;</p>

<p>The look of foolish amaze on Gene&#8217;s face
deepened into one of genuine concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Troubles of her own? What troubles has she
got?&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the most aggravating features of the
situation was that Gene could not be told why
Rose was troubled and his father was cross.
While they were bent under unaccustomed cares,
he went happy and free, with nothing to think of
except the ranch he had stolen. If he had been
any other kind of person, he could have been
taken into the secret and might have helped them
out. The Bonanza King had thought of ways
in which a young and intelligent man could have
been of assistance in inducing Mrs. Dominick
Ryan to listen to reason. Gene, if he&#8217;d had any
ability, if he&#8217;d had the brains of a mouse, could
have made love to her, induced her to run away
with him, and then they could have given her
the money and got rid of her without any more
fuss. He could have been of incalculable value
and here he was, perfectly useless, too much of
a fool even to be <i>told</i> the position, moved by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
mere gross weight of his stupidity into an outside
place of tranquil ignorance. That his father could
not force him to be a sharer in the family troubles
made the old man still more angry, and it was
a poignant pain to him that the only way he
could show his rage was by roaring wrathfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Rose has troubles. Of course she has,
but what have they got to do with you, who don&#8217;t
care about a thing but your damned ranch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with her?&#8221; said Gene,
roused into active uneasiness and quite oblivious
to his father&#8217;s insults. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know anything
was wrong. She didn&#8217;t tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, and she won&#8217;t,&#8221; said the father. &#8220;And
let me tell you if I catch you asking her any
questions or giving her any hints that I&#8217;ve said
anything to you, you can stay on your ranch
and never come back into this house. I won&#8217;t
have Rose worried and upset by every fool that
comes along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, but how am I to find out what&#8217;s the
matter with her,&#8221; said the altogether baffled
brother, &#8220;if you won&#8217;t tell me, and I&#8217;m not to
ask her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t find out. It&#8217;s her affair&mdash;hers
and mine. Don&#8217;t you go poking your nose in
and trying to find out. I don&#8217;t want you butting
into Rose&#8217;s affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just now,&#8221; said Gene in an aggrieved tone,
&#8220;you said I didn&#8217;t take any interest in anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
but my ranch. Now, when I want to take an
interest in Rose, you tell me not to butt in. I
love my sister more than most men, and I&#8217;d like
to know if anything&#8217;s wrong with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got a cold,&#8221; said Cannon.</p>

<p>He spoke sharply and looked at Gene with a
sidelong eye full of observant malice. The young
man gazed back at him, confused, for a moment
half inclined to laugh, thinking his father, in a
sudden unaccustomed playfulness, was joking
with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if it&#8217;s only a cold,&#8221; he stammered, &#8220;it&#8217;s
nothing to tear up the ground about. I thought
it was something serious, that Rose was unhappy
about something. But a cold&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by the sudden appearance
of Rose herself, her hand drawing back the porti&egrave;re
that veiled the doorway. She, who knew her
father so well, had decided that in his present
mood it was better to curtail his after-dinner chat
with Gene. Her quick eye took in their two
faces, and she felt that her brother had probably
had a trying half-hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired of making music,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
played my whole repertoire. Now I want Gene
to come back into the sitting-room with me and
tell me about the linen and the furniture I&#8217;m to
send down to the ranch. We&#8217;ll talk it over
to-night and make a list and arrange for the
packing to-morrow.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>The young man rose, very glad to go with her,
still uneasy and puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s your cold, Rosey?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
know it was bad or I&#8217;d have asked more about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; she said carelessly. &#8220;It
was never really bad, but I stayed in my room
for a few days to be safe.&#8221; Her eye caught her
father&#8217;s, half-shut and full of brooding scorn,
shot through with a gleam of sardonic humor.
Gene&#8217;s half-hour must have been even more trying
than she had at first thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, Gene,&#8221; she said, holding out her
hand to him, &#8220;we&#8217;ll leave the old man to his
dreams. I know he never listened to a note of
my music and only told me to play as an excuse
to get rid of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She threw a laughing look at her father, who
answered it with a lazy, fond cast of his eye in
her direction. Taking Gene&#8217;s hand, she drew
him into the hall and dropped the porti&egrave;re.
The father could hear their voices diminishing
and growing muffled as they passed up the hall
to the sitting-room.</p>

<p>He sat on as they had left him in his favorite
crumpled-up attitude. After all, it was a good
thing the boy did not know, was of the kind who
could not be trusted with any information of
importance. He did not want Gene or anybody
else to interfere. He, Rose&#8217;s father, and he alone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>
without any outside assistance, would reach up
and pick out for her any star that sparkled in the
heavens, any moon for which she might choose
to cry. She wanted Dominick Ryan for her
husband. She should have him and it would
be her father who would get him for her. He
would give her Dominick Ryan, as he would a
pearl necklace or a new automobile to which she
had taken a fancy.</p>

<p>It whetted the old man&#8217;s lust of battle that
Dominick was so hard to get. Sitting fallen
together in his chair he thought about new ways
of approaching Berny, new ways of bribing, or
wheedling, or terrifying her into giving up her
husband. He was not at the end of his rope
yet, by any means. And it lent an added zest
to the game that he had an adversary of so
much spirit. He was beginning to respect her.
Even if he had not been fighting for Rose, he
would have gone on with the struggle for its own
sake. It was not Bill Cannon&#8217;s way to enter a
contest, and then be beaten&mdash;a contest with a
spitfire woman at that.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />


<small>OUT OF THE FULLNESS OF THE HEART</small></h2>
</div>

<p>That night it was Berny&#8217;s turn to be wakeful.
In the silence of the sleeping house and the warm
darkness of her curtained room, she lay tossing
on her bed, hearing the clear, musical striking
of the parlor clock as it marked the hours. When
the first thin streak of gray painted a pale line
between the window curtains she rose and took
a sleeping powder and soon after fell into a heavy
slumber.</p>

<p>This held her in the dead, motionless unconsciousness
that a drug brings, through the long
morning hours. Dominick&#8217;s noiseless departure
hardly disturbed the hushed quiet of the little
flat. The Chinaman, trained by his exacting
mistress to make no sound while she slept, went
about his work with a stealthy step and cautious
touch, even in the kitchen, shut off by space and
muffling doors, continuing his care. He had had
more than one experience with the wrath of Mrs.
Ryan when she had been roused from late slumbers
by a banged door or a dropped pan.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>It was nearly lunch-time when she awoke,
slowly emerging from the black, unbroken deadness
of her sleep to a momentarily augmenting
sense of depression. She rose, her body seeming
to participate in the oppressed discomfort of her
mind, and, going to the bedroom window, drew
the curtain and looked out.</p>

<p>The day promised little in the way of cheering
influences. Fog hung heavy in the air, a gray
veil depending from a gray haze of sky. That
portion of her neighbor&#8217;s garden which the
window commanded was drenched with it, the
flowers drooping moistly as if it weighed on them
like a heavy substance under the pressure of
which they bent and dripped. The stretch of
wall that she could see gleamed with dampness.
A corner of stone, on which a drop regularly
formed, hung and then fell, held her eyes for a
few vacantly-staring moments. Then she turned
away, muttering to herself,</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord, what a day!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was at her lunch when the telephone bell
rang. She dropped her napkin and ran to the
instrument which was in the hall. She did not
know what she expected&mdash;or rather she did not
expect anything in particular&mdash;but she was in
that state of feverish tension when she seemed
the focus of portentous happenings, the point
upon which events of sinister menace might, at
any moment, bear down. Bill Cannon might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>
calling her up, for what purpose she could not
guess, only for something that would be disagreeable
and perturbing.</p>

<p>It was, however, her husband&#8217;s voice that
answered her. He spoke quickly, as if in a hurry,
telling her that he would not be home to dinner,
as a college friend of his from New York had
just arrived and he would dine and go to the
theater with him that evening. Berny&#8217;s ear,
ready to discover, in the most alien subjects,
matter bearing on her husband&#8217;s interest in Rose
Cannon, listened intently for the man&#8217;s name.
As Dominick did not give it she asked for it, and
to her strained and waiting attention it seemed
to come with an intentional indistinctness.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is his name?&#8221; she called again, her
voice hard and high. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t catch it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was repeated and for the second time she
did not hear it. Before she could demand it
once more, Dominick&#8217;s &#8220;Good-by&#8221; hummed
along the wire and the connection was cut.</p>

<p>She did not want any more lunch and went
into the parlor, where she sat down on the cushioned
window-seat and looked out on the vaporous
transparencies of the fog. She had waked with
the sense of weight and apprehension heavy on
her. As she dressed she had thought of the
interview of yesterday with anger and also with
something as much like fear as she was capable
of feeling. She realized the folly of the rage she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>
had shown, the folly and the futility of it, and she
realized the danger of an open declaration of
war with the fierce and unscrupulous old man
who was her adversary. This, with her customary
bold courage, she now tried to push from her
mind. After all, he couldn&#8217;t kill her, and that
was about the only other way he could get
rid of her. Even Bill Cannon would hardly dare,
in the present day in San Francisco, cold-bloodedly
to murder a woman. The thought caused
a slight, sarcastic smile to touch her lips. Fortunately
for her, the lawless days of California
were passed.</p>

<p>With the curtain caught between her finger-tips,
her figure bent forward and motionless, she
looked out into the street as if she saw something
there of absorbing interest. But she saw nothing.
All her mental activity was bent on the problem
of Dominick&#8217;s telephone message. She did not
believe it. She was in that state where trifles
light as air all point one way, and to have Dominick
stay out to dinner with a sudden and unexpected
&#8220;friend from New York&#8221; was more than
a trifle. She assured herself with slow, cold
reiteration that he was dining with Rose Cannon
in the big house on California Street. If they
walked together on Sunday mornings, why
shouldn&#8217;t they dine together on week-day nights?
They were careful of appearances and they would
never let themselves be seen together in any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>
public place till they were formally engaged.
The man from New York was a fiction. She&mdash;that
immaculate, perfect girl&mdash;had invented him.
Dominick could not invent anything. He was
not that kind of man. But Berny knew that
all women can lie when the occasion demands,
and Rose Cannon could thus supply her lover&#8217;s
deficiencies.</p>

<p>With her blankly-staring eyes fixed on the white
outside world, her mental vision conjured up a
picture of them at dinner that night, sitting opposite
each other at a table glistening with the
richest of glass and silver, while soft-footed
menials waited obsequiously upon them. Bill
Cannon was not in the picture. Berny&#8217;s imagination
had excluded him, pushing him out of
the romance into some unseen, uninteresting
region where people who were not lovers dined
dully by themselves. She could not imagine
Rose and Dominick otherwise than alone, exchanging
tender glances over the newest form of champagne
glasses filled with the choicest brand of
champagne.</p>

<p>A sound escaped her, a sound of pain, as
if forced from her by the grinding of jealous
passions within. She dropped the curtain and
rose to her feet. If they married it would be
always that way with them. They would have
everything in the world, everything that to
Berny made life worth while. Even Paris, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>
her three hundred thousand dollars to open all
its doors, would be a savorless place to her if
Rose and Dominick were to be left to the enjoyment
of all the pleasures and luxuries of life
back in California.</p>

<p>Unable to rest, fretted by jealousy, tormented
by her longing for the offered money, oppressed
by uneasiness as to Cannon&#8217;s next move, the
thought of the long afternoon in the house was
unendurable to her. She could not remain unemployed
and passive while her mind was in this
state of disturbance. Though the day was bad
and there was nothing to do down town, she
determined to go out. She might find some distraction
in watching the passers-by and looking
at the shop windows.</p>

<p>By the time she was dressed, it was four o&#8217;clock.
The fog was thicker than ever, hanging over the
city in an even, motionless pall of vapor. Its
breath had a keen, penetrating chill, like that
exhaled by the mouth of a cavern. Coming
down the steps into it she seemed to be entering
a white, still sea, off which an air came that was
pleasant on the heated dryness of her face. She
had no place to go to, no engagement to keep,
but instinctively turned her steps in the down-town
direction. Walking would pass more time
than going on the car, and she started down the
street which slanted to a level and then climbed
a long, dim reach of hill beyond. Its emptiness&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span>
characteristic feature of San Francisco streets&mdash;struck
upon her observation with a sense of
griping, bleak dreariness. She could look along
the two lines of sidewalk till they were lost in
the gradual milky thickening of the fog, and at
intervals see a figure, faint and dreamlike, either
emerging from space in slow approach, or melting
into it in phantasmal withdrawal.</p>

<p>It was a melancholy, depressing vista. She
had not reached the top of the long hill before
she decided that she would walk no farther.
Walking was only bearable when there was
something to see. But she did not know what
else to do or where to go. Indecision was not
usually a feature of her character. To-day,
however, the unaccustomed strain of temptation
and worry seemed to have weakened her resourcefulness
and resolution. The one point on which
she felt determined was that she would not go
home.</p>

<p>The advancing front of a car, looming suddenly
through the mist, decided her. She hailed it,
climbed on board, and sank into a seat on the
inside. There was no one else there. It smelt
of dampness, of wet woolens and rubber overshoes,
and its closed windows, filmed with fog,
showed semicircular streaks across them where
passengers had rubbed them clean to look out.
The conductor, an unkempt man, with an unshaven
chin and dirty collar, slouched in for her fare,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>
extending a grimy paw toward her. As he took
the money and punched the tag, he hummed a
tune to himself, seeming to convey in that
harmless act a slighting opinion of his passenger.
Berny looked at him severely, which made him
hum still louder, and lounge indifferently out to
the back platform where he leaned on the brake
and spat scornfully into the street.</p>

<p>Berny felt that sitting there was worse than
walking. There was no one to look at, there was
nothing to be seen from the windows. The car
dipped over the edge of an incline, slid with an
even, skimming swiftness down the face of the
hill, and then, with a series of small jouncings,
crossed the rails of another line. Not knowing
or caring where she was, she signaled the conductor
to stop, and alighted. She looked round
her for an uncertain moment, and then recognized
the locality. She was close to the old Union
Street plaza on which the Greek Church fronted.
Here in the days before her marriage, when she
and Hazel had been known as &#8220;the pretty Iverson
girls,&#8221; she had been wont to come on sunny
Sunday mornings and sit on the benches with
such beaux as brightened the monotony of that
unaspiring period.</p>

<p>She felt tired now and thought it would not be
a bad idea to cross to the plaza and rest there for
a space. She was warmly dressed and her clothes
would not be hurt by the damp. Threading her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>
way down the street, she came out on the opening
where the little park lies like an unrolled green
cloth round which the shabby, gray city crowds.</p>

<p>She sank down on the first empty bench, and
looking round she saw other dark shapes, having
a vague, huddled appearance, lounging in bunched-up
attitudes on the adjacent seats. They seemed
preoccupied. It struck her that they, like
herself, were plunged in meditation on matters
which they had sought this damp seclusion silently
to ponder. The only region of activity in
the dim, still scene was where some boys were
playing under the faintly-defined outline of a
large willow tree. They were bending close to
the ground in the performance of a game over
which periods of quietness fell to be broken by
sudden disrupting cries. As Berny took her seat
their imp-like shapes, dark and without detail,
danced about under the tree in what appeared a
fantastic ecstasy, while their cries broke through
the woolly thickness of the air with an intimate
clearness, strangely at variance with the remote
effect of their figures.</p>

<p>The fact that no one noticed her, or could
clearly see her, affected her as it seemed to have
done the other occupants of the benches. She
relaxed from her alert sprightliness of pose, and
sank against the back of the seat in the limpness
of unobserved indifference. Sitting thus, her
eyes on the ground, she heard, at first unheeding,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
then with a growing sense of attention, footsteps
approaching on the gravel walk. They were the
short, quick footsteps of a woman. Berny
looked up and saw the woman, a little darker
than the atmosphere, emerging from the surrounding
grayness, as if she were slowly rising to
the surface through water.</p>

<p>Her form detached itself gradually from the
fog, the effect of deliberation being due to the
fact that she was dressed in gray, a long, loose
coat and a round hat with a film of veil about it.
She would have been a study in monochrome but
for the color in the cheek turned to Berny, a
glowing, rose-tinted cheek into which the damp
had called a pink brighter than any rouge.
Berny looked at it with reluctant admiration,
and the woman turned and presented her full
face, blooming as a flower, to the watcher&#8217;s eye.
It was Rose Cannon.</p>

<p>If in these wan and dripping surroundings the
young girl had not looked so freshly fair and
comely, Berny might have let her pass unchecked.
But upon the elder woman&#8217;s sore and bitter
mood the vision of this rosy youthfulness,
triumphant where all the rest of the world sank
unprotesting under the weight of a common
ugliness, came with a sense of unbearable wrong
and grievance. As Rose passed, Berny, with a
sudden blinding up-rush of excitement, leaned
forward and rose.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>&#8220;Miss Cannon,&#8221; she said loudly. &#8220;Oh, Miss
Cannon,&mdash;just a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose turned quickly, looking inquiringly at
the owner of the voice. She had had a vague
impression of a figure on the bench but had not
looked at it. Now, though the face she saw was
unfamiliar, she smiled and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you want to speak to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The ingratiating amiability of her expression
added to Berny&#8217;s swelling sense of injury and
injustice. Thus did this siren smile upon Dominick,
and it was a smile that was very sweet.
The excitement that had seized upon the older
woman made her tremble, but she was glad,
fiercely, burningly glad, that she had stopped
Miss Cannon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;just for a moment, if you
don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose had never seen the woman before, and at
the first glance supposed her to be some form of
peddler or a person selling tickets. The daughter
of Bill Cannon was eagerly sought by members
of her own sex who had wares for sale, and it
did not strike her as odd that she should be
stopped in the plaza on a foggy afternoon. But
a second glance showed her that the woman before
her was better dressed, more assured in manner
than the female vender, and she felt puzzled and
interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had something to say to me?&#8221; she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
queried again, the questioning inflection a little
more marked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but not much. I won&#8217;t keep you more
than a few moments. Won&#8217;t you sit down?&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny designated the bench and they sat on it,
a space between them. Rose sat forward on
the edge of the seat, looking at the strange woman
whose business with her she could not guess.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve never seen me before, have you,
Miss Cannon?&#8221; said Berny. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know
who I am?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young girl shook her head with an air of
embarrassed admission.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If I&#8217;ve ever
met you before, it must have been a long time
ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve never met me,&#8221; said Berny, &#8220;but I
guess you&#8217;ve heard of me. I am the wife of
Dominick Ryan.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said the words easily, but her eyes were
lit with devouring fires as they fastened on the
young woman&#8217;s face. Upon this, signs of perturbation
immediately displayed themselves. For
a moment Rose was shaken beyond speech. She
flushed to her hair, and her eyes dropped. To a
jealous observation, she looked confused, trapped,
guilty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; she said after the first moment of
shock, &#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;I really don&#8217;t think I ever did
meet you.&#8221; With her face crimson she raised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span>
her eyes and looked at her companion. &#8220;If I
have, I must have forgotten it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t,&#8221; said Berny, &#8220;but you&#8217;ve met
my husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose&#8217;s color did not fade, but this time she did
not avert her eyes. Pride and social training
had come to her aid. She answered quietly and
with something of dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I met Mr. Ryan at Antelope when we
were snowed up there. I suppose he&#8217;s told you
all about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Berny, her voice beginning to
vibrate, &#8220;he hasn&#8217;t told me <i>all</i> about it. He&#8217;s
told me just as much as he thought I ought to
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her glance, riveted on Rose&#8217;s face, contained
a fierce antagonism that was like an illumination
of hatred shining through her speech. &#8220;He
didn&#8217;t think it was necessary to tell me <i>everything</i>
that happened up there, Miss Cannon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose turned half from her without answering.
The action was like that of a child which shrinks
from the angry face of punishment. Berny leaned
forward that she might still see her and went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t tell me <i>all</i> that happened up
at Antelope. There are some things that it
wouldn&#8217;t have done for him to tell me. A man
doesn&#8217;t tell his wife about his affairs with other
women. But sometimes, Miss Cannon, she finds
them out.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span>Rose turned suddenly upon her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Ryan,&#8221; she said in a cold, authoritative
voice, &#8220;what do you want to say to me? You
stopped me just now to say something. Whatever
it is, say it and say it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny&#8217;s rages invariably worked themselves out
on the same lines. With battle boiling within
her, she could preserve up to a certain point a
specious, outward calm. Then suddenly, at some
slight, harmless word, some touch as light as the
pressure on the electric button that sets off the
dynamite explosion, the bonds of her wrath were
broken and it burst into expression. Now her
enforced restraint was torn into shreds, and she
cried, her voice quavering with passion, shaken
with breathlessness:</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you suppose I want to say? I want
to ask you what right you&#8217;ve got to try and steal
my husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have <i>no</i> right,&#8221; said Rose.</p>

<p>Berny was, for the moment, so taken aback,
that she said nothing but stared with her whole
face set in a rigidity of fierce attention. After
a moment&#8217;s quivering amaze she burst out,</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what are you doing it for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not doing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a liar,&#8221; she cried furiously. &#8220;You&#8217;re
worse than a liar. You&#8217;re a thief. You&#8217;re trying
to get him every way you know how. You sit
there looking at me with a face like a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span>
innocent, and you know there&#8217;s not a thing you
can do to get him away from me you&#8217;re not doing.
If a common chippy, a gutter girl, acted that way
they&#8217;d call her some pretty dirty names, names
that would make you sit up if you thought any one
would use them to you. But I don&#8217;t see where
there&#8217;s any difference. You think because you&#8217;re
rich and on top of the heap that you can do
anything. Just let me tell you, Miss Rose
Cannon, you can&#8217;t steal Dominick Ryan from me.
You may be Bill Cannon&#8217;s daughter, with all the
mines of the Comstock behind you, but you
can&#8217;t buy my husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose was aghast. The words of Berny&#8217;s
outburst were nothing to her, sound and fury, the
madness of a jealous woman. That this was a
loving wife fighting for the husband whose heart
she had lost was all she understood and heard.
That was the tragic, the appalling thought. The
weight of her own guilty conscience seemed
dragging her down into sickened silence. The
only thing it seemed to her she could honestly
say was to refute the woman&#8217;s accusations that
Dominick was being stolen from her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Ryan,&#8221; she implored, &#8220;whatever else
you may think, do <i>please</i> understand that I am
not trying to take your husband away from you.
You&#8217;re making a mistake. I don&#8217;t know what
you&#8217;ve heard or guessed, but you&#8217;re distracting
yourself without any necessity. How could I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span>
ever do that? I never meet him. I never see
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She leaned forward in her eagerness. Berny
cast a biting, sidelong look at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about Sunday morning on Telegraph
Hill?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did meet him there, that&#8217;s true,&#8221;&mdash;a memory
of the conversation augmented the young girl&#8217;s
sense of guilt. If half this woman said was madness,
half was fact. Dominick loved Rose Cannon,
not his wife, and to Rose that was the whole
tragedy. Meetings, words, renouncements were
nothing. She stammered in her misery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;you must believe me when I
tell you that that time and once before&mdash;one
evening in the moonlight on the steps of our
house&mdash;were the only times I&#8217;ve seen your husband
since I came back from Antelope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Berny, &#8220;I don&#8217;t for a
moment believe you. You must take me for the
easiest fruit that ever grew on the tree if you
think I&#8217;ll swallow a fairy tale like that. If you
met once on Telegraph Hill, and once in the
moonlight, what&#8217;s to prevent your meeting at
other times, and other places? You haven&#8217;t
mentioned the visits up at your house and the
dinner to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose drew back, frowning, uncomprehending.</p>

<p>&#8220;What dinner to-night?&#8221; she said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span>&#8220;The one you&#8217;re going to take with my husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time in the interview, the young
girl was lifted from the sense of dishonesty that
crushed her by a rising flood of angry pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;I take dinner with my father to-night in our
house on California Street,&#8221; she said coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bosh!&#8221; said Berny, giving her head a furious
jerk. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t bother wasting time on
lies like that to me. I&#8217;m not a complete fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Ryan,&#8221; said Rose, &#8220;I think we&#8217;d better
end this talk. We can&#8217;t have any rational conversation
when you keep telling me what I say is
a lie. I am sorry you feel so badly, and I wish I
could say something to you that you&#8217;d believe.
All I can do to ease your mind is to assure you
that I never, except on those two occasions, have
seen your husband since his return from the
country and I certainly never intend to see
him again.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose from the bench and, as she did so,
Berny cried,</p>

<p>&#8220;Then how do you account for the money
that was offered me yesterday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Money?&#8221; said the young girl, pausing as she
stood. &#8220;What money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The three hundred thousand dollars that
your father offered me yesterday afternoon to
leave my husband and let him get a divorce from
me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span>Rose sat down on the bench and turned a
startled face on the speaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me that again,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
quite understand it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny gave a little, dry laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, as many times as you like,&#8221; she said
with her most ironical air of politeness, &#8220;only,
I should think it would be rather stale news to
you by this time. Yesterday afternoon your
father made me his third offer to desert my husband
and force him to divorce me at the end of a year.
The offers have gone up from fifty thousand
dollars&mdash;that was the first one, and, all things
considered, I thought it was pretty mean&mdash;to
the three hundred thousand they tried me with
yesterday. Mrs. Ryan was supposed to have
made the first offer, but your father did the
offering. This last time he had to come out and
show his hand and admit that one-third of the
money was from him.&#8221; She turned and looked
at Rose with a cool, imperturbable impudence.
&#8220;It&#8217;s good to have rich parents, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose stared back without answering. She had
become very pale.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_408.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Then how do you account for the money that was<br /> offered me yesterday?&#8221; <span class="gap">     <i>Page <a href="#Page_407">407</a></i></span></p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Berny, giving her head a judicial
nod, and delivering her words with a sort of
impersonal suaveness, &#8220;is the way it was managed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[409]</span>
you were kept carefully out. I wasn&#8217;t supposed
to know there was a lady in the case, but of course
I did. You can&#8217;t negotiate the sale of a husband
as you do that of a piece of real estate, especially
when his wife objects. That, Miss Cannon, was
the difficulty. While all you people were so
anxious to buy, <i>I</i> was not willing to sell. It takes
two to make a bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose, pale now to her lips, said in a low voice,</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it. It&#8217;s not true.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny laughed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s only fair,&#8221; she said with an air
of debonair large-mindedness. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been telling
you what you say is lies and now you tell me what
<i>I</i> say is lies. It&#8217;s not, and you know it&#8217;s not.
How would I have found out about all this? Do
you think Dominick told me? Men don&#8217;t tell
their wives when they want to get rid of them.
They&#8217;re stupid, but they&#8217;re not <i>that</i> stupid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose gave a low exclamation and turned her
head away. Berny was waiting for a second
denial of her statements, when the young girl
rose to her feet, saying in a horrified murmur,</p>

<p>&#8220;How awful! How perfectly awful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Berny continued, addressing her
back, &#8220;I was to understand <i>you</i> didn&#8217;t know
anything about it. I had my own opinions on
that. Fathers don&#8217;t go round buying husbands
for their daughters unless they know their daughters
are dead set on having the husbands. Bill
Cannon was not trying to get Dominick away from
me just because he wanted to be philanthropic.
Neither was Mrs. Ryan. You&#8217;re the kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span>
wife she wanted for her boy, just as Dominick&#8217;s
the husband your father&#8217;d like for you. So you
stood back and let the old people do the dirty
work. You&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose turned quickly, sat down on the edge of
the bench, and leaned toward the speaker. Her
face was full of a quivering intensity of concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor, unfortunate woman!&#8221; she said in a
shaken voice, and laid her hand on Berny&#8217;s knee.</p>

<p>Berny was so astonished that for the moment
she had no words, but stared uncomprehending,
still alertly suspicious.</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor soul!&#8221; Rose went on. &#8220;If I&#8217;d known
or guessed for a moment I&#8217;d have spoken differently.
I can&#8217;t say anything. I didn&#8217;t know. I
couldn&#8217;t have guessed. It&#8217;s the most horrible
thing I ever heard of. It&#8217;s&mdash;too&mdash;too&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped, biting her lip. Berny saw that
she was unable to command her voice, though
she had no appearance of tears. Her face looked
quite different from what it had at the beginning
of the interview. All its amiable, rosy softness
was gone. The elder woman was too astounded
to say anything. She had a feeling that, just for
that moment, nothing could be said. She was
silenced by something that she did not understand.
Like an amazed child she stared at Rose,
baffled, confused, a little awed. After a minute
of silence, the young girl went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t talk about it. I don&#8217;t altogether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span>
understand. Other people&mdash;they must explain.
I&#8217;ve been&mdash;no, not deceived&mdash;but kept in the
dark. But be sure of one thing, yesterday was
the end of it. They&#8217;ll never&mdash;no one that I
have any power over&mdash;will ever make you such
offers again. I&#8217;ll promise you that. I don&#8217;t
know how it could have happened. There&#8217;s
been a mistake, a horrible, unforgivable mistake.
You&#8217;ve been wronged and insulted, and I&#8217;m sorry,
sorry and humiliated and ashamed. There are
no words&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped again with a gesture of helpless
indignation and disgust, and rose to her feet.
Berny, through the darkness of her stunned astonishment,
realized that she was shaken by feelings
she could not express.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t know anything about it then?&#8221;
the wife said sullenly, wanting still to be defiant
and finding all her defiance overwhelmed by an
invading sensation of feeling small, mean and
contemptible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Know it?&#8221; said the girl, letting a glance of
scorn touch the questioner. &#8220;Know it and let
it go on? But I suppose you&#8217;ve a right to ask
me such a question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I have,&#8221; said Berny, but her voice
did not have any assurance of her conviction on
the subject. It sounded flat and spiritless.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have. You seem to me to have a right
to say anything savage and angry and insulting.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span>
And I can only say to you I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m sorry,
and I ask your pardon&mdash;for me and for the others.
And that doesn&#8217;t make it any easier for you to
bear, or do you any good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny swallowed dryly and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All I can do now is to promise you that it
stops to-day and for ever. You&#8217;ll never be bothered
again by anything of the kind. You can go
back to your home and feel that never again will
any one belonging to me try to come between
you and your husband. I can&#8217;t say any more.
I can&#8217;t talk about it. Good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned away as she spoke and without a
backward look walked rapidly down the gravel
walk to the street. With an immovable, unwinking
gaze, Berny followed her figure as it melted
into the fog. It seemed only a moment before
it was gone, appearing to dissolve into the curd-like
currents that surrounded it.</p>

<p>Berny sat without moving on the bench, staring
in the direction in which it had disappeared.
Her hands lay limp in her lap, the fog beaded in
a crystal hoar on her clothes. She did not notice its
growing chill nor the rapid downcoming of the
dark. Her body was as motionless as a statue,
but her mind was like a still, rankly-overgrown
lake, suddenly churned into activity by unexpected
gales of wind.</p>

<small>THE WALL ACROSS THE WAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was dark when Rose reached home. She
had walked rapidly, mechanically taking familiar
turns, cresting the long slope of the hill at a
panting speed, rounding corners where gushes of
light revealed her as a dark, flitting figure hurrying
by almost at a run.</p>

<p>She was as oblivious to her surroundings as
Berny, left motionless on the park bench. Never
before in her life had anything like this touched
her. Such few troubles as she had known had
been those of a sheltered domestic life&mdash;the life
of a cherished child whose dainty self-respect had
never been blurred by a coarse breath. Now had
come this horrible revelation. It shook the
pretty world she had lived in like an earthquake.
Idols lay broken in the dust. She had often seen
her father rough and brutal as he was to Gene,
but that was a different thing to her father&#8217;s buying
that wretched woman&#8217;s husband, buying him for
her. Berny&#8217;s face rose upon the darkness with
its pitiful assumption of jaunty bravado, its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[414]</span>
mean shrewishness under the coating of powder
and rouge.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could they do it?&#8221; the girl panted to
herself. &#8220;How could they ever do such a thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not suspect Dominick. She could not
have believed he was party to such an action
unless he had told her so with his own lips. As
she hurried on the thought that this was the
woman he had bound himself to for the rest of
his life mingled with the other more poignantly-hateful
thoughts, with a last sickening sense of
wretchedness. The sudden, aghast consciousness
of chaos, of an abrupt demolishing of the pleasant,
familiar settings of a life that never comes to some,
came to Rose that evening as she ran home
through the fog.</p>

<p>She entered the house noiselessly and sped up
to her room. It was time to dress for dinner,
and an old woman-servant who had once been
her nurse was waiting to help her. The mistress
and maid were on terms of affectionate intimacy
and the progress of the toilet was generally
enlivened by gossip and laughter. To-night the
girl was singularly silent, responding with monosyllables
and sometimes not at all to the remarks
of her assistant. As the woman drew the fastenings
of the dress together, she could feel that the
body the gown clipped so closely quivered, like
the casing of machinery, vibrating to powerful
concussions within.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[415]</span>The silence that continued to hold her throughout
dinner passed unnoticed, as Gene was there
and enlivened the passage of the meal by contributing
an almost unbroken stream of talk. The
night before he had been to a play, the plot of
which, and its development in four acts, he now
related with a fullness of detail which testified to
the closeness of his attention and the accuracy of
his memory. As each course was removed from
the table, and the young man could once more
give his undivided attention to the matter of
discourse, he leaned back in his chair and took up
the dropped thread with a fresh zest and some
such remarks as:</p>

<p>&#8220;In the beginning of the next act, the hero
comes in with his hat on, and first he says&#8221;&mdash;and
so on.</p>

<p>With each of these renewals of the narrative the
Bonanza King subsided against his chair-back in a
limp attitude, staring with gloomy fixity at his
boy, and expelling his breath in a long audible
rush of air, which was sometimes a sigh and sometimes
approached the proportions of a groan.</p>

<p>At the end of dinner, when Gene announced his
intention of leaving as he was to attend a vaudeville
performance, the old man began to show
signs of reviving animation, going so far as politely
to ask his son where he was going and with
whom. His manner was marked by a warm,
hearty encouragement, as he said,</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[416]</span>&#8220;Get the whole vaudeville program down by
heart, Gene, and you can tell it to us to-morrow
night. There&#8217;ll be about twelve parts to it, and
Rose can order two extra courses for dinner, and
we might hire some men with stringed instruments
for an accompaniment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gene, with innocent good-humor, responded
gaily.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, father, I&#8217;ll give it my best attention,
and if there&#8217;s anything especially good, I&#8217;ll report
to you. You and Rose might like to go some
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>His father, disappointed that his shaft had
made no impression upon the young man&#8217;s invulnerable
amiability, emitted a scornful snort, and
made no further response to Gene&#8217;s cheery
&#8220;Good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; he said, in tones expressing his relief,
as the porti&egrave;re dropped behind his son&#8217;s departing
figure, &#8220;he&#8217;s gone! Now, Rosey, you and I can
have a talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said his daughter, looking at her coffee-cup,
&#8220;that&#8217;s what I wanted. I want to have a
long talk with you to-night, papa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire away,&#8221; said the old man. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had to
listen to that fool for an hour, and it&#8217;s broken my
spirit. You can say anything you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not here,&#8221; said his daughter; &#8220;in the sitting-room.
I&#8217;ll go in there and wait for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not here? What&#8217;s the matter with here?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[417]</span>
I like it better than the sitting-room. I&#8217;m more
comfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, the servants will want to clear the things
away, and I don&#8217;t want them to hear what I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell the servants to go to hell,&#8221; said the old
man, who, relieved by Gene&#8217;s departure, was
becoming more cheerful.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, this is something&mdash;something serious.
I&#8217;ll go into the sitting-room and wait for you.
When you&#8217;ve finished your coffee, come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose from her chair and walked to the
door. He noticed that she was unusually unsmiling
and it occurred to him that she had been so
all through dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, honey,&#8221; he said, extending his
hand toward her, &#8220;short on your allowance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, it&#8217;s just&mdash;just something,&#8221; she said,
lifting the porti&egrave;re. &#8220;Come when you&#8217;re ready,
I&#8217;ll be there.&#8221;</p>

<p>She walked up the hall to the sitting-room and
there sat down in a low chair before the chimneypiece.
The chill of the fog had penetrated the
house and a fire had been kindled in the grate.
On its quivering fluctuation of flame she fixed her
eyes. With her hands pressed between her knees
she sat immovable, thinking of what she was
going to say, and so nervous that the blood sang
in her ears and the palms of her hands, clasped
tight together, were damp. She had never in her
life shrunk so before an allotted task. It sickened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[418]</span>
her and she was determined to do it, to thresh it
out to the end. When she heard her father&#8217;s
step in the passage her heart began to beat like
a woman&#8217;s waiting for her lover. She straightened
herself and drew an inspiration from the bottom
of her lungs to try to give herself breath wherewith
to speak.</p>

<p>The old man flung himself into an arm-chair
at one side of the fireplace, jerked a small table
to his elbow, reached creakingly for an ash tray,
and, having made himself comfortable, took his
cigar from his mouth and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s hear about this serious matter
that&#8217;s making you look like a tragedy queen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> serious,&#8221; she said slowly. &#8220;It&#8217;s something
that you won&#8217;t like to hear about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit me with it,&#8221; he said, wondering a little
what it could be. &#8220;Gene&#8217;s gone and a child
could eat out of my hand now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking into the fire, Rose said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I was out walking this afternoon and down
in the Union Street plaza a woman stopped me.
I&#8217;d never seen her before. She was Mrs. Dominick
Ryan.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man&#8217;s face became a study. A certain
whimsical tenderness that was generally in it
when he spoke to his daughter vanished as if by
magic. It was as if a light had gone out. He
continued to look at her with something of
blankness in his countenance, as if, for the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span>
moment of shock, every faculty was held in suspense,
waiting for the next words. He held his
cigar, nipped between a pair of stumpy fingers,
out away from him over the arm of the chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;and what had she to
say to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The most disagreeable things I think any one
ever said to me in my life. If they&#8217;re true,
they&#8217;re just too dreadful&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she stopped, balking
from the final disclosure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you tell me what they were?&#8221; he
said with the same almost hushed quietness.</p>

<p>&#8220;She said that you and Mrs. Ryan were offering
her money&mdash;a good deal of money, three hundred
thousand dollars was the amount, I think&mdash;to
leave her husband so that he could get a divorce
from her, and then&mdash;&#8221; she swallowed as if to
swallow down this last unbearable indignity,&mdash;&#8220;and
then be free to marry me.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Berny had told all. If deep, unspoken curses
could have killed her, she would have died that
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it true?&#8221; Rose asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes,&#8221; said the old man in a perfectly
natural tone of dubious consideration, &#8220;it&#8217;s a
fairly accurate statement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, papa,&#8221; cried his daughter, &#8220;how could
you have done it? How could you have
done such a thing? Such a hateful, horrible
thing.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[420]</span>&#8220;Horrible thing?&#8221; he repeated with an air of
almost na&iuml;ve astonishment. &#8220;What&#8217;s horrible
about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know. I don&#8217;t have to tell you; you
know. Don&#8217;t say to me that you don&#8217;t think
it&#8217;s horrible. Don&#8217;t make me feel as if we were
suddenly thousands of miles apart.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bonanza King knew that in many matters,
in most matters involving questions of ethics,
they were more thousands of miles apart than she
even now suspected. That was one of the
reasons why he would have liked to kill Berny,
who, for the first time, had brought this
dissimilarity in their points of view to his daughter&#8217;s
unwilling consideration. He spoke slowly
and vaguely to gain time. He knew it was a
critical moment in the relations between himself
and the one creature in the world he loved.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to feel that way, dearie,&#8221;
he said easily. &#8220;Maybe there are things in this
matter you don&#8217;t know about or understand.
And, anyway, what&#8217;s there so horrible in trying
to separate a man and woman who are unhappily
married and can&#8217;t bear the sight of each other?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were separating them for me,&#8221; she said
in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; he answered with a slight
rocking movement of his shoulders and a manner
of almost bluff deprecation, &#8220;I can say that I
wasn&#8217;t, but suppose I was?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[421]</span>She paid no attention to the last part of the
sentence, and replied,</p>

<p>&#8220;The woman said you were.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not answer for a minute, the truth being
that he did not know what it was best to say,
and wanted to wait and let her make statements
that he could either contradict or seek to justify.</p>

<p>&#8220;What made you think I wanted to marry
Dominick Ryan?&#8221; she said slowly, her eyes on
the fire.</p>

<p>This was a question that went to the core of
the subject. He knew now that he could not
put her off, or slip from the responsibilities of the
occasion. Drawing himself to the edge of his
chair, he leaned forward and spoke with a sincerity
and feeling that made his words very
impressive.</p>

<p>&#8220;One evening when I was at Antelope, I came
into the sitting-room and saw my daughter in
the arms of Dominick Ryan. I knew that my
girl wasn&#8217;t the woman to let a man do that
unless she loved him. That was how I came to
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Rose in a faint tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Afterward I heard from Dominick of what his
marriage was. I heard from his mother, too.
Then I saw his wife and I got a better idea from
her what it was than I did from either of the
others. That fellow, the man my daughter cared
for, was tied up in a marriage that was hell. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[422]</span>
was bound to a woman who could only be managed
with a club, and Dominick was not the kind
that uses a club to a woman. What liking he&#8217;d
had for her was gone. She stuck to him like a
barnacle because she wanted to get money, was
ready to hang on, feet and hands, till Delia Ryan
was dead and then put up a claim for a share of
the estate. Do you think a man&#8217;s doing such a
horrible thing to break up a marriage like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Rose, &#8220;I do. It was a marriage.
They&#8217;d taken each other for better or for worse.
They&#8217;d made the most solemn promises to each
other. Neither you nor any one else had a right
to interfere.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke with a hard determination, with
something of an inflexible, unrelenting positiveness,
that was very unusual in her, which surprised
and, for the moment, silenced her father. It
rose from a source of conviction deeper than the
surface emotions of likes and dislikes, of loves
and hates, of personal satisfactions and disappointments.
At the core of her being, with
roots extending through all the ramifications of
her mental and moral nature, was a belief in the
inviolability of the marriage tie. It was a conviction
founded on neither tradition, nor reason,
nor expediency, a thing of impulse, of sex, an
hereditary instinct inherited from generations
of virtuous women, who, in the days of their
defenselessness, as in the days of their supremacy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[423]</span>
knew that the most sacred possessions of their
lives&mdash;their husbands, their children, their homes&mdash;rested
on its stability. All the small, individual
preoccupations of her love for Dominick, her
pity for his sufferings, were swept aside by this
greater feeling that she did not understand or
reason about. She obeyed an instinct, elemental
as the instinct of motherhood, when she refused
to admit his right to break the bond he had
contracted.</p>

<p>Her father stared at her for the moment, chilled
by a sense of unfamiliarity in her sudden assumption
of an attitude of challenge and authority.
He had often heard her inveigh against the
divorces so lightly obtained in the world about
them. He had thought it one of those pretty
ornamental prejudices of hers, that so gracefully
adorned her youth and that he liked her to have
when they did not interfere with anything of
importance. Now, set up like a barrier in the
path, he stopped before this one particular
prejudice, perplexed at its sudden intrusion,
unwilling to believe that it was not a frail, temporary
obstruction to be put gently aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now listen, honey,&#8221; said he persuasively,
&#8220;that&#8217;s all very well. I&#8217;ve got no right to interfere,
and neither, we&#8217;ll admit, has anybody.
But sometimes you have to push away these
little rights and polite customs. They&#8217;re very nice
for every-day use, but they&#8217;re not for big occasions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[424]</span>
I suppose the Good Samaritan didn&#8217;t really have
any right to stop and bind up the wounds of the
man he found by the wayside. But I guess the
feller he bound up was almighty glad that
the Samaritan didn&#8217;t have such a respect for etiquette
and wait till he&#8217;d found somebody to
introduce them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, papa, that was different. Don&#8217;t confuse
me and make me seem a fool. I can&#8217;t talk like
you. I can&#8217;t express it all clearly and shortly.
I only know it&#8217;s wrong; it&#8217;s a sin. I wouldn&#8217;t
marry Dominick Ryan if he was divorced that
way if it killed me to give him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So if the woman voluntarily took the money
and went away and got Dominick to grant her
the divorce, Dominick being, as we know, a man
of good record and spotless honor, you&#8217;d refuse
to marry him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would, certainly I would. It would be
perfectly impossible for me to marry him under
those circumstances. I should consider I was
committing a sin, a particularly horrible and
unforgivable sin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See here now, Rosey, just listen to me for a
minute. Do you know what Dominick Ryan&#8217;s
marriage is? I don&#8217;t suppose you do. But you do
know that he married his mistress, a woman who
lived with him eight months before he made her his
wife. She wasn&#8217;t an innocent young girl by any
means. She knew all right where she was going.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[425]</span>
She established that relation with him with the
intention of marrying him. She&#8217;s a darned smart
woman, and a darned unscrupulous one. That&#8217;s
not the kind of woman a man feels any particular
respect for, or that a girl like you&#8217;d give a lot of
sympathy to, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that that would make any difference,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not thinking of her character,
I&#8217;m thinking of her rights.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t her character and her rights sort
of dovetail into each other?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t see that they do. The law&#8217;s
above the character or the person. It&#8217;s the law,
without any question of the man or the woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh Rosey, dear, you&#8217;re talking like a book,
not like a girl who&#8217;s got to live in a world with
ordinary people in modern times. This woman,
that you&#8217;re arguing about as if she was the mother
of the Gracchi, hasn&#8217;t got any more morality or
principle than you could put on the point of a pin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s been quite good and proper since her
marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, let&#8217;s leave her and look at Dominick&#8217;s
side. He marries her honorably and lives
with her for nearly three years. Every semblance
of affection that he had for her gets rubbed off
in those three years, every illusion goes. He&#8217;s
tied to a woman that he can&#8217;t stand. He went
up to Antelope that time because they&#8217;d had some
sort of a scrap and he felt he couldn&#8217;t breathe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[426]</span>
in the same house with her. He told me himself
that they&#8217;d not lived as man and wife for nearly
a year. Now, I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re going
to say, but <i>I</i> think to keep on living in <i>that</i> state
is all wrong. I&#8217;ll borrow your expression, I
think it&#8217;s a sin.&#8221;</p>

<p>She answered doggedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awful, but she&#8217;s his wife. Oh, if you&#8217;d
seen her face when she talked to me, her thin,
mean, common face, all painted and powdered
and so miserable!&#8221;</p>

<p>He thought she was wavering, that he saw in
this unreasonable, illogical dodging of the point
at issue a sign of defeat, and he pushed his advantage.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&mdash;a girl of heart and feeling like
you&mdash;would condemn that man and woman to
go on living that lie, that useless, purposeless
lie? I can&#8217;t understand it. What good comes
of it? What&#8217;s the necessity for it? Do you
realize what a man Dominick might be if he was
married to the right woman, and had a decent
home where he could live like a Christian? Why,
he&#8217;d be a different creature. He&#8217;d have a future.
He&#8217;d make his place in the community. All the
world would be before him, and he&#8217;d mount up
to where he belongs. And what is he now?
Nothing. All the best in him&#8217;s paralyzed by
this hell of a box he&#8217;s got himself into. The
man&#8217;s just withering up with despair.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[427]</span>It was almost too much. For a moment she
did not answer, then said in a small voice like a
child&#8217;s,</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re making this very hard for me, papa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, Rosey!&#8221; he cried, exasperated,
&#8220;you&#8217;re making it hard for yourself. It&#8217;s you
with your cast-iron prejudices, and your obstinacy,
who are making it hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got them,&#8221; she said, rising to her
feet. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got them, and they&#8217;ll stay with me
till I die. Nothing&#8217;s going to change me in this.
I can&#8217;t argue and reason about them. They&#8217;re
part of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She approached the mantelpiece, and, leaning
a hand on it, looked down at the fire. The light
gilded the front of her dress and played on her
face, down-drooped and full of stern decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite true,&#8221; she said slowly, &#8220;that I
love Dominick. I love him with the best I&#8217;ve
got. It&#8217;s true that I would like to be his wife.
It would be a wonderful happiness. But I can&#8217;t
have it, and so there&#8217;s no good thinking about it,
or trying to bring it about. It can&#8217;t be, and
we&mdash;you too, papa&mdash;must give it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pressed himself back in his chair, looking
at her with lowering, somber disapprobation&mdash;a
look he had seldom had cause to level at his
daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re going to condemn this poor devil,
who loves you and whom you say you love, to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[428]</span>
future that&#8217;s going to kill any hope in him?
You&#8217;re going to say to him, &#8216;You can be free,
and make something of your life, and have the
woman you want for your wife, but <i>I</i> forbid all
that, and I&#8217;m going to send you back to prison.&#8217;
I can&#8217;t seem to believe that it&#8217;s my Rosey who&#8217;s
saying that, and who&#8217;s so hard and inhuman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rose turned from the fire. He noted an
expression almost of austerity on her face that
was as new to him as the revelation of obstinacy
and indifference to his will she had shown to-night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa, you don&#8217;t understand what I feel.
It&#8217;s not what you want, or what I want, or what
Dominick wants. It&#8217;s not what&#8217;s going to please
us and make us comfortable and happy. It&#8217;s
something that&#8217;s much more important than
that. I can&#8217;t make Dominick happy and let him
make his life a success at the expense of that
woman. I can&#8217;t take him out of prison, as you
call it, because he&#8217;s got a responsibility in the
prison, that he voluntarily took on himself, and
that he&#8217;s got to stand by. A man can&#8217;t stay by
his marriage only as long as it&#8217;s pleasant. He
can&#8217;t throw down the woman he&#8217;s made his wife just
because he finds he doesn&#8217;t like her. If she&#8217;s been
disagreeable that&#8217;s a misfortune, but it doesn&#8217;t
liberate him from the promises he&#8217;s made.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you think when a man like Dominick
Ryan, hardly more than a boy, makes a mistake
that ruins his life, he&#8217;s got to stay by it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[429]</span>&#8220;Yes, he must. He&#8217;s given a solemn promise.
He must keep it. Mistake or sin doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man was silent. He had presented
his case as strongly and persuasively as he knew
how, and he had lost it. There was no longer any
use in arguing with that unshakable feminine
obstinacy, rooted, not in reason but in something
rock-like, off which the arguments of reason harmlessly
glanced. He had a dim, realizing sense
that at the bottom of the woman&#8217;s illogical,
whim-driven nature, there was that indestructible
foundation of blind, governing instincts, and that
in them lay her power.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that lets me out,&#8221; he said, turning to
knock off the long ash on his cigar. &#8220;I guess
there&#8217;s no use, Rosey, for you and me to try to
come to an agreement on this matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, there isn&#8217;t. And don&#8217;t let&#8217;s talk about
it any more.&#8221; She turned from the fire and
came toward him. &#8220;But you must promise me
one thing&mdash;that that woman is to be let alone, that
no one&mdash;you or any one you have any control
over&mdash;makes any more offers of money to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>She came to a stand beside his chair. He
wanted to hold out his hand to her as was his
custom when she stood near him, but he was
afraid that she might not take it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I can promise that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll not
offer her any more money. I don&#8217;t want to see
her again, God knows.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[430]</span>It was an easier promise to make than Rose
guessed. The old man, under an air of mild
concurrence in her demands, experienced a
sensation of cynical amusement at the thought
that the first move for a reopening of negotiations
must come from Berny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I&#8217;ll promise that,&#8221; he said amicably.
&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be afraid that I&#8217;m going to go
on offering her a fortune. The thing&#8217;s been done,
the woman&#8217;s refused it, and there it stands.
I&#8217;ve no desire to open it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>She leaned down to take his hand. He relinquished
it to her with an immense lightening of
his heart, and peace fell on him as he felt her rub
her cheek against his knuckles.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re not mad at the old man, after all?&#8221;
he said almost shyly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;not at <i>him</i>. I was
angry at what he was doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a subtly feminine way of getting round
the delicate points of the situation&mdash;that inconsistently
feminine way which separates judgment of
the individual from judgment of his acts. But it relieved
the Bonanza King of the heaviest weight that
had lain upon him for many years, and, for once,
he gave thanks for the irrationalness of women.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, good-night, honey,&#8221; he said, &#8220;no matter
what crazy notions you&#8217;ve got you&#8217;re the old
man&#8217;s girl all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>She kissed him.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[431]</span>&#8220;And you won&#8217;t forget your promise?&#8221; she
murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; he said stoutly, not sure just
what she was alluding to. &#8220;Any promise I make
to you stands put till the Day of Judgment.
Good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>When she left him, he lit another cigar, sank
lower in his chair and stared at the fire.</p>

<p>It was a deadlock. In his helplessness, the
enraged helplessness of the man who had ridden
triumphantly over all obstacles that fate had set
in his path, his prevailing thought was how much
he would like to kill Berny. She had done all
this. This viper of a woman, the kind to tread
on if she raised her head, had baffled and beaten
them all. He could not murder her, but he
thought with grim lips of how he could crush and
grind her down and let her feel how heavy Bill
Cannon&#8217;s hand could be.</p>

<p>It seemed for the moment as if everything were
over. They had reached a place where a blank
wall stretched across the road. Berny&#8217;s refusing
the money had been a serious obstacle, but not
an unconquerable one. Rose to-night had given
the whole plot its death blow. With lowering
brows he puffed at his cigar, groping in his mind for
some way that might yet be tried. He could not
brook the thought of defeat. And yet the more he
meditated the more impregnable and unscalable
appeared the wall that stretched across the way.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[432]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br />


<small>FRIEND OR FOE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>For some time after Rose had left her, Berny
remained on the bench, not moving, her glance
resting on that part of the path whence the young
girl&#8217;s figure had faded from view.</p>

<p>The night slowly deepened, impregnating the
gray atmosphere with a velvety depth of shadow
that oozed through it like an infusion of a darker,
denser element. Lights came out. First sporadically,
here and there blooming through the opaque
dusk, not suddenly, but with an effect of gradualness,
as though the air was so thick it took some
time to break through it. Then came more.
Rows of windows appeared in long, magnified
sputters. All round the plaza there was a suggestion
of effaced brightness, as of a painting
which had once been sharply outlined and brilliant
but was now rubbed into a formless, impressionist
study of shadows and undefined, yellow blurs.
The golden halos of lamps blotted the dark at
intervals, and now and then the figures, which
had occupied the benches, passed into the circles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[433]</span>
of vaporous illumination, and passed out of them,
as if they had been crossing the stage of a theater.</p>

<p>Berny did not move and did not notice the
increasing chill of the hour or the moisture beading
on her clothes like wintry rime. She was sunk
in an abyss of thought, a suspended trance of
contemplation, of receptivity to new ideas. In
one hour her basic estimate of human nature,
her accepted measurement of motives and standards,
had been suddenly upset. Her point of
view was like a kaleidoscope, which is unexpectedly
turned. Sitting motionless on the bench she saw
the familiar aspect of life fallen into new shapes,
taking on alien forms.</p>

<p>She realized that Dominick had never been
happy with her, and, for the first time, she understood
the gulf between them. She saw what the
life was that he had wanted to lead, and that
he could have led with the other woman. It
would have been that very form of existence which
Berny had always derided, and thought an outward
expression of the inward dullness of people
who had children, looked shabby, and did not
care for money. Now she felt unsure as to whether
her scorn of it was not foolish and unenlightened.
As in a sudden forward shoot of a search-light,
she saw them&mdash;Dominick and Rose&mdash;happy in
a way she had never dreamed of being happy,
in a world so far from hers that she had never
before had a clear look at it, a man and woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[434]</span>
concentrated upon the piece of life that belonged
to them, living passionately for each other,
indifferent to all that seemed to her of value.</p>

<p>She brought her mental vision back from this
upon herself and felt shaken and slightly sick.
Seeing beyond the circle of her own experience
and sensation for the first time, she would have
said to any companion who might have shared
her thoughts, &#8220;No wonder Dominick didn&#8217;t get
on with me!&#8221; For a dispassionately-contemplative
moment she saw herself in Dominick&#8217;s eyes;
she saw their married life as it had been to him.
She felt sorry for both of them&mdash;for him in his
forced acquiescence with the conditions around
him, for herself because of her ignorance of all
he had wanted and expected.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t be any different,&#8221; she whispered
to herself, &#8220;that&#8217;s the way I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>She never could be any different. She was one
kind of woman and Rose Cannon was another,
and Dominick belonged to Rose Cannon&#8217;s kind.
She did not know that it was so much better
than her kind but it was different. They made
her feel like an outsider in a distant world, and
the feeling gave her a sensation of deadly depression.
The burning heat of resentment that had
made her speak to Rose was gone. All the burning
heats and angers of the last two months
seemed to belong to the past. An icy, nostalgic
ache of loneliness had hold of her. The accustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[435]</span>
sense of intimacy and warm, enjoying
interest in the world&mdash;what we mean when we talk
of &#8220;living&#8221;&mdash;had been completely drawn out
of her.</p>

<p>The cold, biting in to her marrow, at last woke
her to a realization of her surroundings, and she
sat upright, looking blinkingly to the right and
left. The half-lit plaza lay like a lake of shadow
surrounded by a circlet of light and girdled by
noise. It was like the brightness and animation
of the world flowing round her but not touching
her, as she sat alone in the darkness.</p>

<p>She rose suddenly, determined to escape from
her gloomy thoughts, and walked toward the
upper end of the square, directing her steps to
the Spanish and Italian section of the city which
is called the Latin Quarter. She walked
slowly, not knowing where to go, only determined
that she would not go home. She thought for
a moment of her sisters&#8217;, where she could have
dinner and find the cheer of congenial society.
But on consideration she felt that this, too, was
more than she could just now bear. They would
torment her with questions and she felt in no
mood to put them off or to be confidential.
Finally she remembered a Mexican restaurant,
to visit which had at one time been a fashion.
She had been there with Hazel and Josh, and
once in a party with some of the bank people.
She knew where the place was and felt that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[436]</span>
could dine there with no fear of encountering
any one she knew.</p>

<p>With an objective point in view, her step
gained decision, and she moved forward briskly,
leaving the plaza and plunging into the congeries
of picturesque streets which harbor a swarming
foreign population. The lights of shops and open
stalls fell out into the fog, transforming it into
thick, churning currents of smoky pallor. Wet
walls and sidewalks showed a gold veneer, and
lingering drops, trembling on cornices, hung like
tiny globes of thin yellow glass.</p>

<p>People and things looked magnified and sometimes
horrible seen through this mysterious,
obscuring medium. Once behind a pane of glass
she saw lines of detached, staring eyes, fastened
glaringly on her as she advanced. It was the
display in an optician&#8217;s show-window, where glass
eyes were disposed in fanciful lines, like a decoration.
She looked at them askance, feeling that
there was something sinister in their wide, unwinking
scrutiny. She hurried by the market stalls,
where the shawled figures of women stood
huddled round the butcher&#8217;s block. They looked
as if they might be grouped round a point of
interest, bending to stare at something lying there,
something dreadful, like a corpse, Berny thought.</p>

<p>When she saw the Mexican restaurant she felt
relieved. The strange atmospheric conditions
seemed to have played upon her nerves and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[437]</span>
was glad to get somewhere where she could find
warmth and light and people. The place, a little
shabby house dating from the era of the projecting
shingle roof and encircling balcony, stood on a
corner with windows on two streets. It was
built upon a slope so sharp that the balcony,
which in front skirted the second story, in the
back was on a level with the sidewalk. The
bright light of gas-jets, under shades of fluted
white china, fell over the contents of the show-window.
They were not attractive. A dish of
old and shriveled oranges stood between a plate
of tamales and another of red and green peppers.
There were many flies in the window, and, chilled
by the cold, they stood along the inside of the glass
in a state of torpor.</p>

<p>Berny pushed open the door and entered.
The front part of the place was used as a grocery
store and had a short counter at one side, behind
which stood shelves piled high with the wares
demanded by the Mexican and Spanish population.
Back of this were the tables of the restaurant.
The powerful, aromatic odors of the groceries
blended with the even more powerful ones of the
Mexican menu. The room was close and hot.
In a corner, his back braced against the wall, a
Spaniard, with inky hair and a large expanse of
white shirt bosom, was languidly picking at a
guitar.</p>

<p>Berny knew that there was an inner sanctum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[438]</span>
for the guests that preferred more secluded
quarters, and walked past the counter and between
the tables. An arched opening connected with
this room. Coarse, dirty, lace curtains hung in
the archway and, looped back against gilt hooks,
left a space through which a glimpse of the
interior was vouchsafed to the diners without.
It was smaller than the restaurant proper, and
was fitted up with an attempt at elegance. Lace
curtains&mdash;also coarse and dirty&mdash;veiled the windows,
and two large mirrors, with tarnished and
fly-spotted gilt frames, hung on the wall opposite
the entrance.</p>

<p>Just now it was sparsely patronized. In one
corner two women in mourning and a child were
sitting. They glanced at Berny with languid
curiosity and then resumed a loud and voluble
conversation in Spanish. A party of three Jews,
an over-dressed woman and two young men&mdash;evidently
visitors from another part of town&mdash;sat
near them. On the opposite side there was
no one. Berny slipped noiselessly into a chair
at the corner table, her back against the partition
that shut off the rest of the dining-room. She
felt sheltered in this unoccupied angle, despite
the fact that the mirror hanging opposite gave a
reflection of her to any one standing in the
archway.</p>

<p>The cloth was dirty and here and there showed
a hole. Her ineradicable fastidiousness was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[439]</span>
strong in her even at this hour, when everything
that was a manifestation of her own personality
seemed weak and devitalized. She was disgustedly
clearing away the crumbs of the last occupant
with daintily-brushing movements of her finger-tips,
when the waiter drew up beside her and
demanded her order. It was part of this weird
evening, when natural surroundings seemed to
combine with her own overwrought condition to
create an effect of strangeness and terror, that the
waiter should have been an old, shriveled man
of shabby and dejected mien, with a defect in one
eye, which rendered it abnormally large and
prominent under a drooping, reddened lid. In
order to see well it was necessary for him to hold
his head at a certain angle and bring the eye,
staring with alarming wildness, upon the object
of his attention. His aspect added still further
to Berny&#8217;s dissatisfaction. She resolved to eat
little and leave the place as soon as possible.</p>

<p>When her soup came, a thin yellow liquid in
which dark bits of leaves and herbs floated, she
tasted it hesitatingly, and, after a mouthful or
two, put down her spoon and leaned back against
the wall. She felt very tired and incapable of
any more concentration of mind. Her thoughts
seemed to float, disconnectedly and indifferently,
this way and that, like a cobweb stirred by air
currents and half held by a restraining thread.
To her dulled sense of observation the laughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[440]</span>
of the Jewish party came mingled with the tinkling
of the guitar outside, and the loud, continuous
talk from the Spanish women in the corner.</p>

<p>The waiter brought fish&mdash;a fried smelt&mdash;and she
roused herself and picked up her fork. She did
not notice that a man was standing near her in
the archway, the edge of the lace curtain in his
hand, looking about the room. He threw a side
glance at her which swept her shoulders, her hat,
and her down-bent profile, and looked away.
Then, as if something in this glimpse had suddenly
touched a spring of curiosity, he looked back again.
His second survey was longer. The glance he
bent upon her was sharp and grew in intensity.
He made no attempt to enter or to move nearer
her, but any one watching him would have seen
that his interest increased with the prolongation
of his scrutiny.</p>

<p>As if afraid of being observed he cast a quick
surreptitious look over the room, which in its
circuit crossed the mirror. Here, reflected from
a different point of view, Berny was shown in
full face, her eyes lowered, her hands moving over
her plate. The man scanned the reflection with
immovable intentness. Berny laid down her fork
and pushed the fish away with a petulant movement,
and the watcher drew back behind the lace
curtain. Through its meshes he continued to
stare at the mirror, his lips tightly shut, his face
becoming rigid in the fixity of his observation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[441]</span>The waiter entered, his arms piled with dishes,
and she made a beckoning gesture to him. He
answered with a jerk of his head, and, going to
the table where the Spanish women sat, unloaded
his cargo there, as he set it out exchanging remarks
with the women in their own language and showing
no haste to answer Berny&#8217;s summons. She
moved in her chair and muttered angrily. The
man behind the lace curtain advanced his head
and through the interstices of the drapery tried
to look directly at her. In this position he could
only catch a glimpse of her, but he saw her hand
stretched forward to take one of the red beans
from the glass saucer in the middle of the table.
It was an elegant hand, the skin smooth and white,
the fingers covered with rings. She again beckoned,
this time peremptorily, and the waiter
came. The listener could hear her voice distinctly
as he watched her reflection in the glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you come when I beckoned?&#8221;
she said sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I had other people to wait on,&#8221; said
the waiter with equal asperity. &#8220;They was
here before you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with the dinner to-night?
It&#8217;s all bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t cooked it,&#8221; retorted the man, growing
red with indignation, his swollen eye glaring
fiercely at her. &#8220;And no one else&#8217;s complained.
I guess it&#8217;s what&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[442]</span>Berny made an angry movement&mdash;sometimes
alluded to as &#8220;flouncing&#8221;&mdash;and turned her head
away from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get me an enchilada,&#8221; she said peremptorily,
&#8220;and after that some frijoles. I don&#8217;t want
anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>The waiter moved away and the man behind
the curtain, as if satisfied by his long survey,
also turned back into the general room. Close
to the opening there was an unoccupied table,
and at this he sat down, laid his hat on the chair
beside him, and unfastened his coat. To the
servant who came for his order, he asked for a
cup of black coffee and a liqueur glass of brandy.
He also requested an evening paper. With the
sheet open before him he sat sipping the coffee,
the slightest noise from the inner room causing
him to start and lift the paper before his face.</p>

<p>He sat thus for some fifteen minutes. The
Spanish women and the child emerged from the
archway and left the restaurant, and a few
moments later he heard the scraping of chair
legs and Berny&#8217;s voice as she asked for her bill.
He lifted the paper and appeared buried in its
contents, not moving as Berny brushed back the
lace curtain and passed him. Her eyes absently
fell on him and she had a vague impression of the
dark dome of a head emerging from above the
opened sheets of the journal. As she rustled by
he lowered the paper and followed her with a keen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[443]</span>
watchful glance. He did not move till the street
door closed behind her, when he threw the paper
aside, snatched up his hat and flicked a silver
dollar on to the cloth.</p>

<p>&#8220;No change,&#8221; he said to the waiter, who came
forward.</p>

<p>The surprised servant, unaccustomed to such
tips, stared astonished after him as he hurried
down the passage between the tables, quickly
opened the door and disappeared into the darkness
of the street.</p>

<p>Berny was only a few rods away, moving forward
with a slow, loitering step. It was an easy night
to follow without being observed. Walking at a
prudent distance behind her, he kept her in sight
as she passed from the smaller streets of the Latin
Quarter into the glare and discord of the more
populous highways, along Kearney Street, past the
lower boundary of Portsmouth Square. He noticed
that she walked without haste, now and then
glancing at a window or a passer-by. She was
like a person who has no objective point in view,
or at least is in no hurry to reach it.</p>

<p>But this did not seem to be the case, for when
she reached the square she took her stand on the
corner where the Sacramento Street cars stop.
The man drew back into a doorway opposite.
They were the only passengers who boarded the
car at that corner, Berny entering the closed
interior, the man taking a seat on the outside.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[444]</span>
He had it to himself here, and chose the end
seat by the window. Muttering imprecations at
the cold, he turned up his overcoat collar and
drew his soft felt hat down over his ears. By
turning his head he could see between the bars
that cross the end windows, the interior of the
car shining with light, its polished yellow woodwork
throwing back the white glare of the electricity.
There were only three passengers, two
depressed-looking women in dingy black, and
Berny on a line with himself in the corner by the
door. He could see her even better here than
in the restaurant. She sat, a small dark figure,
pressed into the angle of the seat, her hands
clasped in her lap, her eyes down. Her hat cast
a shadow over the upper part of her face, and
below this the end of her nose, her mouth and
chin were revealed as pale and sharply-cut as an
ivory carving. She seemed to be sunk in thought
and sat motionless; the half of her face he could
see, looking very white against her black fur
collar.</p>

<p>He was furtively surveying her, when she
started, glanced out of the window and signed to
the conductor to stop. The man on the front
dropped to the ground and stole lightly round the
car, so that its moving body hid him from her.
Emptiness and silence held the street, and he
could easily follow her as she walked upward
along the damp and deserted sidewalk. Halfway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[445]</span>
up the block a building larger than those
surrounding it rose into the night. A mounting
file of bay-windows broke its fa&ccedil;ade, and, a few
steps above the level of the pavement, a line of
doors with numbers showing black on illuminated
transoms revealed it to the man opposite as a
flat building. Here Berny stopped and without
hesitation, evidently as one who was familiar
with the place, mounted the steps and walked to
the last of the doors.</p>

<p>The man, with soft and careful footsteps,
crossed the street. As he drew nearer he saw
that she was not using a latch-key, but was
waiting to be admitted, leaning as if tired against
the wall. He had reached the sidewalk when
the door opened, vouchsafing him a bright,
unimpeded view of a long flight of stairs carpeted
in green. Berny entered and for a moment,
before the door closed, he saw her mounting
the stairs. She had not asked for any one, or
indeed made a sound of greeting or inquiry.
She was therefore either expected or an habitu&eacute;
of the place. When the door was shut he, too,
mounted the porch steps and read the number
on the transom. He whispered it over several
times, the light falling out on his thin, aquiline
face with a sweep of dark hair drooping downward
toward his collar.</p>

<p>Satisfied with his investigation, he left the
porch and walked rapidly down the street to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[446]</span>
corner. Here there was a lamp, and halting
under its light he drew from his pocket a leather
wallet and took therefrom Dominick Ryan&#8217;s card
with an address written on it. The penciled
numbers were the same as those on the door he
had just left, and he stood looking fixedly at the
card, an expression of excitement and exultation
growing on his face.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br />


<small>THE ACTOR&#8217;S STORY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The afternoon of the next day Dominick came
home earlier than usual. His New York friend,
who was en route to Japan, had but a couple of
days in San Francisco, and again claimed his
company for dinner. The theater was to follow
and Dominick had come home to change his
clothes, and incidentally either to see Berny and
explain his absence or to leave a message for her
with the Chinaman.</p>

<p>He felt rather guilty where she was concerned.
He had seen nothing of her for two days. The
only time they met was in the evening after
business hours, the only meal they took together
was dinner. With every spark of affection dead
between them, their married life the hollowest
sham, she had so long and so sternly trained him
to be considerate of her and keep her on his
mind, that he still instinctively followed the
acquired habit of thinking of her comfort and
arranging for it. He knew she would be annoyed
at the two lonely dinners, and hoped to see her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[448]</span>
before he left and suggest to her that she telephone
for one of her sisters to join her.</p>

<p>The flat was very quiet when he entered, and
after looking into one or two rooms for her he
called the Chinaman, who said Mrs. Ryan had gone
out early in the afternoon, leaving no message
except that she would be home to dinner. Dominick
nodded a dismissal and walked into the den.
He carried the evening papers in his hand, and
looking at the clock he saw that he had an hour
before it would be necessary for him to dress and
leave the house. Berny would undoubtedly be
home before then; she was rarely out after six.
Meantime, the thought that she was not in and
that he could read the papers in unmolested,
uninterrupted silence caused a slight sense of
relief to lighten the weight that was now always
with him.</p>

<p>He had hardly opened the first sheet when
a ring at the bell dispelled his hopes. It was one
of his wife&#8217;s habits never to carry a latch-key,
which she looked upon as a symbol of that
bourgeois, middle-class helpfulness that she had
shaken off with her other working-girl manners
and customs. Dominick dropped the paper,
waiting for her entrance, and framing the words
with which he would acquaint her with the fact
that he was to be absent again. Instead, however,
of the rustle of feminine skirts, he heard the
Chinaman&#8217;s padding steps, and the servant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[449]</span>
entered and presented him with a card. Traced
on it in a sprawling handwriting was the name
&#8220;James Defay Buford.&#8221; Dominick remembered
his invitation to the man to call, and realized
that this probably was the only time that the
actor could conveniently do so. There was an
hour yet before dinner would be served, and turning
to the servant Dominick told him to show the
gentleman up.</p>

<p>A moment later, Buford entered, smiling,
almost patronizingly urbane and benign. He was
dressed with a rich and careful elegance which
gave him a somewhat dandified air. After bestowing
upon Dominick greetings that sounded as
unctuous as a benediction, he took his seat at
the end of the cozy corner facing the door which
led into the hall. From here he looked at the
young man with a close, attentive scrutiny, very
friendly and yet holding, under its enfolding
blandness, something of absence, of inattention,
as though his mind were not in the intimate
customary connection with the words that issued
from his lips. This suggestion of absence deepened,
showed more plainly in an eye that wandered
to the door, or, as Dominick spoke, fell to the
carpet and remained there, hidden by a down-drawn
bush of eyebrow. Dominick was in the
middle of a query as to the continued success
of the &#8220;Klondike Monologue&#8221; when the actor
raised his head and said politely, but with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[450]</span>
politeness that contained a note of haste and
eagerness beneath it,</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Madame at home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she&#8217;s not at home,&#8221; said Madame&#8217;s
husband. &#8220;But she may be in any moment
now. She generally goes out for the afternoon
and gets back about this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you can tell me,&#8221; said Buford,
looking sidewise at his gloves and cane as they
lay on the end of the divan, &#8220;who&mdash;you&#8217;ll pardon
my seeming curiosity, but I&#8217;ll explain it presently&mdash;who
was the lady that came in here last
night at about half-past seven?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up and Dominick was suddenly
aware that his face was charged with the tensest,
the most vital interest. Thrust forward, it showed
a hungriness of anticipation that was almost
passionate. The young man was not only surprised
at the expression but at the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t an idea,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t home
to dinner last night, and didn&#8217;t get in till late.
Why do you want to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For many reasons, or for one, perhaps&mdash;for
one exceedingly important reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, his eyes again turned slantingly on
the stick and gloves, his lips tight-pressed, one
against the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you know any woman came in here
last night at that hour? Did you come up to call?&#8221;
asked Dominick.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[451]</span>&#8220;No&mdash;no&mdash;&#8221; the other spoke with quick
impatience evidently from the surface of his
mind, &#8220;no, it was&mdash;at first, anyway&mdash;purely
accidental. I saw the woman&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;afterward
I saw her enter here. Mr. Ryan,&#8221; he said
suddenly, looking at his vis-&agrave;-vis with piercing
directness and speaking with an intensity of
urgency that was almost a command, &#8220;can you
give me half an hour of your time and your full
attention? I want to speak to you of a matter,
that to me, at least, is of great&mdash;the greatest&mdash;importance.
You can help me; at least you can,
I hope, throw some light on what is a dark subject.
Have I your permission to talk freely to you,
freely and at length?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dominick, who was beginning to feel as if he
were in a play, and was exceedingly surprised
and intrigued, nodded, remarking,</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, certainly, go on. If I can be of any help
to you or explain anything for you, nothing
would give me greater pleasure. Let me hear
what it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>The actor dropped his glance to the floor for
what seemed an anxiously-considering moment,
then he raised his head and, looking directly at
his host, said,</p>

<p>&#8220;You may remember that, while at Antelope,
I once spoke to you of having been married&mdash;of
having, in fact, been unfortunate enough to
lose my wife.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[452]</span>Dominick remembered, but it seemed imperfectly,
for he said in a doubtful tone, which had
more than a suggestion of questioning,</p>

<p>&#8220;She&mdash;er&mdash;she died?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;she did not die. I
lost her in a way that I think was more painful
than death. She left me, voluntarily, of her own
free will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course,&#8221; said the young man hastily.
&#8220;I remember perfectly, one day by the sitting-room
fire. I remember it all as clearly as possible
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the time&mdash;the only time I mentioned
the subject to you. On another occasion I spoke
to that lovely and agreeable young lady, Miss
Cannon, on the matter, and told her more fully
of my domestic sorrows. But to you I made but
that one allusion. May I now, more at length,
tell you of the misfortunes&mdash;I may say tragedy&mdash;of
my married life?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dominick, mystified, nodded his head. He
could not imagine why Buford should come to
him at this particular moment and in this particularly
theatrical manner with the history of his
domestic troubles. But he was undeniably interested,
and feeling himself more than ever like a
character in a play, said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on. Tell me anything you like. And if
in any way I can be of use to you, I&#8217;ll be only
too happy to do it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[453]</span>Looking at the carpet, a heat of inward excitement
showing through the professional pomposity
of his manner, Buford began slowly and
solemnly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go back to seven years ago, when I was
in Chicago. Previous to that, Mr. Ryan, I will
tell you in confidence I had been a preacher, a
Methodist, of good reputation, though, I am fain
to confess, of small standing in the church. I
left that esteemed body as I felt there were
certain tenets of the faith I could not hold to.
I am nothing if not honest, and I was too honest
to preach doctrines with all of which I could not
agree. I left the church as a pastor though I
have never deserted it as a disciple, and have
striven to live up to its standards.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, and Dominick, feeling that he spoke
sincerely, said,</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the only thing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it seemed to me. I left the town where
I was living and moved to Chicago where, through
the influences of a friend, I obtained a position in
a school of acting and elocution. I instructed
the pupils in voice production. You may have
noticed that I have an unusually deep and
resonant voice. Through that, I obtained this
work and received the stipend of thirty-five
dollars a week. It was fairly good pay, the hours
were not too long, there was no demand made of
a sacrifice of conscience, and I confess that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[454]</span>
felt much freer and more contented than I had
in the church.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was at this stage of my career that I met
the lady who became my wife. We lived at the
same boarding-house&mdash;Mrs. Heeney&#8217;s, a most
elegant, well-kept place, and Mrs. Heeney a lovely
woman of one of the best southern families. It
was at her table that I met the girl who was
destined to have such a fatal influence on my
life. She was a stenographer and typewriter in
one of the largest firms in the city, earning her
twenty dollars a week, as she was an expert and
not to be beaten in the state. She was very
pretty, the brunette type of beauty, black-eyed,
and as smart as a steel trap. She was as dainty
as a pink, always well-dressed and up-to-date,
never anything sloppy or slouchy about her.
Ask her to go to the theater and there wouldn&#8217;t
be a woman in the house who could beat her for
looks and style. Besides that, she was a fine
conversationalist, could talk as easily as a book
on any subject. If I brought her a novel,
she&#8217;d read it and have the whole plot at her
finger-ends, and be able to talk it all over,
have her own opinions about every character.
Oh, she was an accomplished, fascinating woman,
if I say it myself! Any man might have taken
to her. She was for ever telling me about
California, and how she wanted to get back
there&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[455]</span>&#8220;California?&#8221; interrupted Dominick. &#8220;Did she
come from California?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From here&mdash;from San Francisco. She was
a native daughter of the state and the town. I
was interested in California myself at that time,
though I&#8217;d never seen it, and we&#8217;d talk of that
and other things till, bit by bit, we drifted nearer
and nearer together and the day came when we
were engaged. I thought that was the happiest
day of my life, and it would have been if she&#8217;d
stayed true to her promises.&#8221;</p>

<p>The clock struck the single silvery note of the
half-hour and Dominick heard it. He was interested
in the story, but he had only another half-hour
to give, and said as Buford paused,</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on. It&#8217;s very interesting. Don&#8217;t stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The first step in our married life that seemed
to me strange, that cast, not what you&#8217;d call a
cloud, but a shadow, over my happiness, was
that she insisted on keeping the marriage secret.
She had several reasons, all of which seemed good
and sufficient to her. She said her people would
not like her marrying a stranger away from
home, and that they&#8217;d cut up very ugly when they
heard it. Her principal reason, and the only
one that seemed to me to have any force, was
that she feared she&#8217;d lose her job. She had it
on good authority that the firm where she worked
wouldn&#8217;t employ married women, and if they
knew she&#8217;d got a husband who was making a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[456]</span>
fair salary, they&#8217;d give her the sack. Whether
it was for all the reasons together, or for just
this one I don&#8217;t know, but she&#8217;d only marry me
if I&#8217;d solemnly promise to keep the matter secret.
I&#8217;d have promised her anything. She&#8217;d out and
out bewitched me.</p>

<p>&#8220;So we were married and went to housekeeping
in a little flat in a suburb. We had our mail
sent to our old address at Mrs. Heeney&#8217;s. She
was in our secret, the only person who was. We
had to let her know because of the letters, and
inquiries that might have been made for us from
time to time. We were married in the winter,
and that winter was the happiest time of my life.
I&#8217;ll never forget it. That little flat, and that
little black-eyed woman,&mdash;they were just Paradise
and the angel in it for me. Not but what she
had her faults; she was hot-tempered, quick to
flare up, and sharp with her tongue. But <i>I</i> never
cared&mdash;just let her sputter and fizz till she&#8217;d
worked it all off and then I&#8217;d take things up where
they were before the eruption began. It was a
happy time&mdash;a man in love and a woman that
keeps him loving&mdash;you can&#8217;t beat it this side of
Heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dominick made no answer. The actor for a
moment was silent and then with a sigh went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it was too good to last. Anyway,
it ended. We&#8217;d lived that way for six months
when in the beginning of June the Dramatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[457]</span>
School failed and I lost my job. It came on us
with almost no warning, and it sort of knocked
us out for a bit. <i>I</i> wasn&#8217;t as upset by it as Mrs.
Carter was, but she&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s Mrs. Carter?&#8221; said Dominick.</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife. That&#8217;s my name, Junius Carter.
Of course the name I use on the stage is not my
own. I took that in the Klondike, made it up
from my mother&#8217;s and the name of a pard I had
who died. Well, as I was saying, Mrs. Carter took
it hard. She couldn&#8217;t seem to get reconciled to it.
I tried to brace her up and told her it would only
be temporary, and I&#8217;d get another place soon,
but she was terribly upset. We&#8217;d lived well, not
saved a cent, furnished the flat nicely and kept
a servant. There was nothing for it but to live
on what she made. It was hard on her, but I&#8217;ve
often thought she might have been easier on me.
I didn&#8217;t <i>want</i> to be idle or eat the bread she paid
for, the Lord knows! I tried hard enough to get
work. I tramped those streets in sun and rain
till the shoes were falling off my feet. But the
times were hard, money was tight, and good jobs
were not to be had for the asking. One of the
worst features of the case was that I hadn&#8217;t any
regular line of work or profession. The kind of
thing I&#8217;d been doing don&#8217;t fit a man for any kind
of job. If I couldn&#8217;t do my own kind of stunt
I&#8217;d have to be just a general handy-man or stevedore,
and I&#8217;m not what you&#8217;d call rugged.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[458]</span>&#8220;It was an awful summer! The heat was fierce.
Our little flat was like an oven and, after my
long day&#8217;s tramp after work, I used to go home
just dead beat and lie on the lounge and not
say a word. My wife was worn out. She wasn&#8217;t
accustomed to warm weather, and that and the
worry and the hard work sort of wore on her,
and there were evenings when she&#8217;d slash round
so with her tongue that I&#8217;d get up, half-dead as
I was, and go out and sit on the door-step till
she&#8217;d gone to bed. I&#8217;m not blaming her. She
had enough to try her. Working at her machine
all day in that weather would wear anybody&#8217;s
temper to a frazzle. But she said some things
to me that bit pretty deep. It seemed impossible
it could be the same woman I&#8217;d got to know so
well at Mrs. Heeney&#8217;s. We were both just about
used up, thin as fiddle-strings, and like fiddle-strings
ready to snap at a touch. Seems queer
to think that thirty-five dollars a week could
make such a difference! With it we were in
Paradise; without it we were as near the other
place as people can get, I guess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it was too much for her. She was one
of those women who can&#8217;t stand hardships and
she couldn&#8217;t make out in the position she was in.
Love wasn&#8217;t enough for her, there had to be
luxury and comfort, too. One day I came home
and she was gone. No,&#8221; in answer to a look of
inquiry on Dominick&#8217;s face, &#8220;there was no other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[459]</span>
man. She wasn&#8217;t that kind, always as straight
as a string. No, she just couldn&#8217;t stand the
grind any longer. She left a letter in which she
said some pretty hard things to me, but I&#8217;ve
tried to forget and not bear malice. It was a
woman half crazy with heat and nerves and
overwork that wrote them. The gist of it was
that she&#8217;d gone back to California, to her sisters
who lived there, and she was not coming back.
She didn&#8217;t like it,&mdash;marriage, or me, or Chicago.
She was just going to throw the whole business
overboard. She told me if I followed her, or
tried to hold her, she&#8217;d disappear, hinted that she&#8217;d
kill herself. That was enough for me. God
knows if she didn&#8217;t want me I wasn&#8217;t going to
force myself upon her. And, anyway, she knew
fast enough I couldn&#8217;t follow her. I hadn&#8217;t money
to have my shoes patched, much less buy a ticket
to California.</p>

<p>&#8220;After that there were some dark days for
me. Deserted, with no money, with no work,
and no prospects&mdash;I tell you that&#8217;s the time the
iron goes down into a man&#8217;s soul. I didn&#8217;t know
what was going to become of me, and I didn&#8217;t
care. One day on the street I met an old chum
of mine, a fellow called Defay, that I hadn&#8217;t seen
for years. He was going to the Klondike, and
when he heard my hard-luck story, he proposed
to me to join forces and go along with him. I
jumped at it, anything to get away from that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[460]</span>
town and state that was haunted with memories
of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was just the beginning of the gold rush
and we went up there and stayed for two years.
Defay was one of the finest men I ever knew.
Life&#8217;s all extremes and contrasts; there&#8217;s a sort
of balance to it if you come to look close into it.
I&#8217;d had an experience with the kind of woman
that breaks a man&#8217;s heart as you might a pipe-stem,
then I ran up against the kind of man
that gives you back your belief in human nature.
He died of typhoid a year and a half after we got
there. I had it first and nearly died; in fact,
the rumor went out that it was I that was dead
and not Defay. As I changed my name and
went on the stage soon afterward, it was natural
enough for people to say Junius Carter was dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was pretty near starving when I drifted on
the stage. I had learned some conjuring tricks,
and that and my voice took me there. I just
about made a living for a year, and then I
floated back down here. I never played in San
Francisco till now. I acted on the western
circuits, used to go as far East as Denver and
Kansas City, and then swing round the circle
through the northwestern cities and Salt Lake.
I managed to make a living and no more. I
was cast in parts that didn&#8217;t suit me. The
&#8216;Klondike Monologue&#8217; was the first thing I did
that was in my line.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[461]</span>&#8220;Did you never see or hear of your wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a word. I didn&#8217;t know whether she was
dead or living till last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buford raised his eyes and looked piercingly
into the young man&#8217;s face. Dominick forgot
the time, his engagement, Berny&#8217;s anticipated
entrance. He drew himself up in his chair and
said in a loud, astonished voice,</p>

<p>&#8220;Last night? Then the woman you saw here
last night was your <i>wife</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>The actor gravely inclined his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw my wife,&#8221; he said solemnly, &#8220;last night
at Deledda&#8217;s restaurant. It was entirely by
accident. I liked the Mexican cooking and had
been more than once to that place. Last night
I was about to enter the back part of the restaurant
when I saw her sitting there alone in the corner.
For a moment I could not believe my eyes. I
got behind a lace curtain and watched her. She
was changed but it was she. I heard her speak
to the waiter and if I&#8217;d never seen her face I&#8217;d
have known the voice among a thousand. She&#8217;d
grown stouter and I think even prettier, and she
looked as if she were prosperous. She was well-dressed
and her hands were covered with rings.
When she went out I followed her and she came
straight here from the restaurant and rang the
bell and came in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure she didn&#8217;t go into one of the
other flats? There are four in the building.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[462]</span>&#8220;No, she came in here. I compared the number
on the transom with the address you&#8217;d given
me on the card.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What an extraordinary thing!&#8221; said Dominick.
&#8220;It&#8217;s evidently some one my wife knows
who came to see her that evening, probably to
keep her company while I was out. But I can&#8217;t
think who it could be.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried to run over in his mind which one of
Berny&#8217;s acquaintances the description might fit
and could think of no one. Probably it was
some friend of her working-girl days, who had
dropped out of her life and now, guided by Fate
had unexpectedly reappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly a remarkable coincidence,&#8221; he
went on, &#8220;that she should have come to this
flat, one of the few places in the city where you
know the people. If she&#8217;d gone to any of the
others&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A ring at the bell stopped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; he said, &#8220;that&#8217;s Mrs. Ryan. Now
we&#8217;ll hear who it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment they both sat silent, listening,
the actor with his face looking sharp and pale in
the suspense of the moment, the muscles of his
lean cheeks working. The rustle of Berny&#8217;s
dress sounded from the stairway and grew in
volume as she slowly ascended. The two men
rose to their feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in the den for a moment, Berny,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[463]</span>
Dominick called. &#8220;There&#8217;s a gentleman here
who wants to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rustle advanced up the hall, and the
porti&egrave;re was drawn back. Bernice, brilliantly
dressed, a mauve orchid pinned on her bosom,
stood in the aperture, smiling.</p>

<p>Buford&#8217;s back was against the light, and, for
the first moment she only saw him as a tall
masculine outline and her smile was frank and
natural. But he saw her plain as a picture and
before Dominick could frame the words of introduction,
started forward, crying,</p>

<p>&#8220;Bernice Iverson!&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew back as if struck and made a movement
to drag the porti&egrave;re over her. Her face
went white to the lips, the patches of rouge
standing out on her cheeks like rose-leaves pasted
on the sickly skin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&mdash;who&#8217;s that?&#8221; she stammered, turning
a wild eye on Dominick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Ryan,&#8221; the actor cried, beside himself
with excitement, &#8220;<i>this</i> is my wife! This is the
woman I&#8217;ve been talking of! Bernice, don&#8217;t you
know me? Junius Carter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s crazy,&#8221; she faltered, her lips so loose
and tremulous they could hardly form the words.
&#8220;I never saw him before. I don&#8217;t know what
he&#8217;s talking about. Who&#8217;s Junius Carter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my wife, Mr. Buford,&#8221; said Dominick,
who had been staring from one to the other in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[464]</span>
blank astonishment. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been married nearly
three years. I don&#8217;t understand&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Bernice Iverson, the girl I married in
Chicago, that I&#8217;ve just been telling you about,
that I saw last night at the Mexican restaurant.
Why, she can&#8217;t deny it. She can&#8217;t look at me and
say she doesn&#8217;t know me&mdash;Junius Carter, the
man she married in the Methodist chapel, seven
years ago, in Chicago. Bernice&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He approached her and she shrank back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep away from me,&#8221; she cried hoarsely,
stretching out a trembling hand. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
what you&#8217;re talking about. You&#8217;re crazy.
Junius Carter&#8217;s dead&mdash;&#8221; then suddenly turning on
Dominick with a blazing look of fury&mdash;&#8220;It&#8217;s you
that have done this! It&#8217;s you, you snake! I&#8217;ll be
even with you yet!&#8221;</p>

<p>She tore herself out of the folds of the porti&egrave;re
which she had clutched to her and rushed into
the hall and into her own room. The banging of
the door behind her shook the house.</p>

<p>The two men stood as she had left them, staring
at each other, not knowing what to say, speechless
and aghast.</p>

<small>THE LAST INTERVIEW</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The night was falling when Buford left. He and
Dominick had sat on in the den, talking together
in low voices, going over past events in the concatenation
of circumstances that had led up to the
extraordinary situation in which they now found
themselves. Both listened with strained ears
for the opening of Bernice&#8217;s door, but not a sound
came from her room. Each silently, without
expressing his thoughts to the other, wondered
what she would do, what sensational move might
now be expected of her. While they talked, it
was evident she intended to make no sign of life.</p>

<p>After Buford had left, Dominick called up his
friend on the telephone telling him that he would
be unable to meet him at dinner. He knew that
Berny could hear every word he uttered, and
with indescribable dread he expected that she
would open her door and accost him. But again
she preserved an inviolate invisibility, though
beneath her portal he could see a crack of light
and could hear her moving about in the room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[466]</span>He went into his own room, lit the gas, and
began packing his trunks. He was dazed and
stupefied by what had occurred, and almost the
only clearly-defined idea he had was to leave the
house and get far from the presence of the woman
who had so ruthlessly poisoned his life. He was
in the midst of his packing when the Chinaman
summoned him to dinner, but he told the man
he cared for nothing and would want no breakfast
on the following morning. The servant, who by
this time was well aware that the household was
a strange one, shrugged his shoulders without
comment and passed on to the door of his mistress&#8217;
room, upon which he knocked with the low,
deferential rap of the Chinese domestic. Berny&#8217;s
voice sounded shrilly, through the silence of the
flat:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away! Let me alone! If that&#8217;s dinner I
don&#8217;t want any.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sound of her voice pierced Dominick with
a sense of loathing and horror. He stopped in
his packing, suddenly deciding to leave everything
and go, go from the house and from her as
soon as he could get away. He thrust into a
valise such articles as he would want for the
night and set the bag by the stair-head while he
went into the parlor to find some bills and letters
of his that he remembered to have left in the
desk. As he passed Berny&#8217;s door, it flew open
and she appeared in the aperture. The room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[467]</span>
behind her was a blaze of light, every gas-jet lit
and pouring a flood of radiance over the clothes
outspread on the bed, the chairs, and the floor.
She, herself, in a lace-trimmed petticoat and loose
silk dressing-sack, stood in the doorway staring
at Dominick, her face pinched, white, and fierce.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; she said abruptly.
&#8220;Going away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, stopping at the sight of
the dreaded apparition. &#8220;That&#8217;s my intention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>He gave her a cold look and made no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to your mother&#8217;s?&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>He moved forward toward the parlor door and
she came out into the passage, looking after him
and repeating with a tremulous, hoarse persistence,
&#8220;Dominick, answer me. Are you going to
your mother&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am,&#8221; he said over his shoulder.</p>

<p>He had an unutterable dread that she would
begin to speak of the situation, of Buford, of her
past life; that she would try to explain and exonerate
herself and they would be plunged into a
long and profitless discussion of all the
sickening, irremediable wretchedness of the past.
He could not bear the thought of it; he would
have done anything to avoid it. He wanted to
escape from her, from the house where she had
tortured him, where he seemed to have laid down
his manhood, his honor, his faith, and seen her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[468]</span>
trample on them. The natural supposition that
he would want to confront her with her deception
and hear her explanation was the last thing he
desired doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go to your mother&#8217;s,&#8221; she cried, following
him up the hall, &#8220;for to-night, Dominick,
please. And don&#8217;t tell her. I beg, I pray of
you, don&#8217;t tell her till to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her manner was so pleadingly, so imploringly
insistent, that he turned and looked somberly
at her. She was evidently deeply in earnest, her
face lined with anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the last thing I&#8217;ll ever ask of you.
I know I&#8217;ve got no right to ask anything, but
you&#8217;re generous, you&#8217;ve been kind to me in the
past, and it&#8217;ll not cost you much to be kind just
once again. Go to a hotel, or the club, or anywhere
you like, but not to your mother&#8217;s and
don&#8217;t tell her till to-morrow afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared at her without speaking, wishing she
would be silent and leave him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not trouble you after to-morrow. I&#8217;ll go,
I&#8217;ll get out. You&#8217;ll never be bothered by me
any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go to the club. Let
me alone, that&#8217;s all, and let me go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And&mdash;and,&#8221; she persisted, &#8220;you won&#8217;t tell
her till to-morrow, to-morrow afternoon?&#8221;</p>

<p>He had entered the parlor in which the Chinaman
had lit the lamps, and opening the desk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[469]</span>
began hunting for his papers. To her last words
he returned no answer, and she crept in after
him and stood in the doorway, leaning against
the woodwork of the door-frame.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t tell her till to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow,
say, after three?&#8221;</p>

<p>He found the letters and drew them out of
their pigeonhole.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he almost shouted. &#8220;I won&#8217;t tell
her. But, for God&#8217;s sake, leave me alone and
let me go. If you keep on following me round
this way I won&#8217;t answer for what I&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You promise then,&#8221; she said, ignoring his
heat. &#8220;You promise you&#8217;ll not tell her till after
three?&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned from the desk, gave her a look of
restrained passion, and said, &#8220;I promise,&#8221; then
passed by her as she stood in the doorway and
walked to the stair-head. Here his valise stood,
and snatching it up he ran down the stairs and
out of the house.</p>

<p>Bernice, hearing the door shut, returned to her
room and went on with the work of sorting her
wardrobe and packing her trunks. She did it
deliberately and carefully, looking over each garment,
and folding the choicer articles between
sheets of tissue paper. At midnight she had not
yet finished, and under the blaze of the gases,
looking very tired, she went on smoothing skirts
and pinching up the lace on bodices as she laid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[470]</span>
them tenderly on the trays that stood on the
bed, the table, and the sofa. The night was far
spent before everything was arranged to her
satisfaction and she went to bed.</p>

<p>She was up betimes in the morning. Eight
o&#8217;clock had not struck when she was making a
last tour of the parlor, picking up small articles
of silver and glass that she crowded down into
cracks in the tightly-packed trunks. At breakfast
the Chinaman, an oblique, observant eye on her,
asked her what he should prepare for lunch.
Conscious that if she told him she would not be
back he might become alarmed at the general
desertion and demand his wages, she ordered an
even more elaborate menu than usual, telling
him she would bring home a friend.</p>

<p>She breakfasted in her wrapper and after the
meal finished her toilet with the extremest solicitude.
Never had she taken more pains with
herself. Though anxiety and strain had thinned
and sharpened her, the fever of excitement which
burnt in her temporarily repaired these ravages.
Her eyes were brilliant without artificial aid; her
cheeks a hot dry crimson that needed no rouge.
The innate practicality of her character asserted
itself even in this harassed hour. Last night she
had put the purple orchid in a glass of water on
the bureau. Now, as she pinned it on her breast,
she congratulated herself for her foresight, the
pale lavender petals of the rare blossom toning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[471]</span>
altogether harmoniously with her dress of dark
purple cloth.</p>

<p>Before she left the room she locked the trunks
and left beside them a dress suit-case packed for
a journey. Standing in the doorway she took
a hurried look about the apartment&mdash;a last,
farewell survey, not of sentiment but of investigation,
to see if she had forgotten anything. A
silver photograph frame set in rhinestones caught
her eye and she went back and took it up, weighing
it uncertainly in her hand. Some of the rhinestones
had fallen out, and she finally decided it
was not worth while opening the trunks to put
in such a damaged article.</p>

<p>It was only a quarter past nine when she
emerged from the flat. She took the down-town
car and twenty minutes later was mounting the
steps to Bill Cannon&#8217;s office. She had been
motionless and rigidly preoccupied on the car,
but, as she approached the office, a change was
visible in her gait and mien. She moved with
a light, perky assurance, a motion as of a delicate,
triumphant buoyancy seeming to impart itself
to her whole body from her shoulders to her feet.
A slight, mild smile settled on her lips, suggesting
gaiety tempered with good humor. Her eye was
charged with the same expression rendered more
piquant by a gleam&mdash;the merest suggestion&mdash;of
coquettish challenge.</p>

<p>The Bonanza King was already in his office.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[472]</span>
The same obsequious clerk who had shown her
in on a former occasion took her card in to the
inner sanctum where the great man, even at this
early hour, was shut away with the business which
occupied his crowded days. In a moment the
young man returned smiling and quite as murmurously
polite as he had been on her former
visit, and Berny was once again ushered into the
presence of the enemy.</p>

<p>The old man had read the name on the card
with a lowering glance. His command to admit
the visitor had been hardly more than an inarticulate
growl which the well-trained clerk understood,
as those about deaf mutes can read their
half-made signs. Cannon was not entirely surprised
at her reappearance, and mingled feelings
stirred in him as he turned his swivel chair away
from the table, and sat hunched in it, his elbows
on its arms, his hands clasped over his stomach.</p>

<p>She came in with an effect of dash, confidence,
and brilliancy that astonished him. He had
expected her almost to sidle in in obvious, guilty
fear of him, her resistance broken, humbly coming
to sue for the money. Instead, a rustling, scented
apparition appeared in the doorway, more gracious,
handsome, and smiling than he had ever
thought she could be. She stood for a moment,
as if waiting for his invitation to enter, the whole
effect of her rich costume, her feverishly high
coloring, and her debonair and self-confident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[473]</span>
demeanor, surprising him into silence. A long
white feather on her hat made a background for
her darkly-flushed face and auburn hair. There
were some amethysts round her neck, their purple
lights harmonizing richly with the superb flower
pinned on her breast. Her eyes looked very
black, laughing, and provocative through her
spotted veil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said in a gay voice, &#8220;here I am
again! Is it a surprise?&#8221;</p>

<p>She advanced into the room, and the old man,
almost unconsciously, rose from his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sort of,&#8221; he said dryly.</p>

<p>She stopped by the desk, looked at him
sidewise, and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Do we shake hands?&#8221;</p>

<p>His glance on her was hard and cold. Berny
met it and could not restrain a sinking of the
courage that was her most admirable characteristic
and that she had screwed far past its ordinary
sticking-point that morning. She sank down into
the same arm-chair that she had occupied on her
former visit and said, with a little languid effect
of indifference,</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, never mind. We don&#8217;t have to
waste time being polite. That&#8217;s one of the most
convenient things about our interviews. We just
say what we really think and there&#8217;s no need
bothering about humbug.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So glad to hear it,&#8221; said the old man with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[474]</span>
his most ironical air. &#8220;Suppose then you let
me know what you&#8217;ve come down to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you guess?&#8221; she answered, with an
expression that was almost one of flirtatious
interrogation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nup,&#8221; he answered, looking steadily at her.
&#8220;I have to have it said in that plain style with no
politeness that you say is the way we always talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; she answered briskly. &#8220;Here it
is as plain as A B C. I&#8217;ve decided to accept
your offer and take the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up at him, smiling gallantly. But
as her eye caught his her smile, try as she would
to keep it, died. He suddenly realized that she
was extremely nervous, that her lips were dry,
and the hand she put up to adjust her veil, and
thus hide her intractable mouth, was shaking.
The admiration he had of late felt for her insolent
fearlessness increased, also he began to feel that
now, at last, he was rising to the position of
master of the situation. He leaned back in the
swivel chair and glowered at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;you&#8217;ve a gall
that beats anything I&#8217;ve ever seen. Two days
ago you busted this business higher than a kite
by stopping my daughter on the public street
and telling her the whole story. You did the one
thing you knew I&#8217;d never forgive; and you ended
the affair, hammered the nails in its coffin and
buried it. Now you come flourishing into my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[475]</span>
office as if nothing had happened and say you&#8217;ll
take the money. It beats me how you&#8217;ve got
the nerve to dare to show your face in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berny listened with the hand holding the veil
pressed against her mouth and her eyes staring
over it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all straight enough,&#8221; she burst out,
&#8220;what you say about telling your daughter.
I did it and I was crazy. I&#8217;ll admit that. But
you&#8217;ll have to admit on your side that it was
pretty rough the way I was treated here, ordered
out like a peddler. I was sore, and it was you
that made me so. And I&#8217;ll not deny that I
wanted to hit you back. But you brought it on
yourself. And, anyway, what does it matter if
I go? Maybe your daughter&#8217;s mad and disgusted
now, but women don&#8217;t stay that way for ever.
If I get out, drop out of sight, the way I intend
to do, give Dominick his freedom, isn&#8217;t she going
to forget all about what I said? Wouldn&#8217;t any
woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bonanza King made no answer. He had
no intention of talking with this objectionable
woman about his daughter. But in his heart
hope sprang at the words. They were an echo of
his own desires and opinions. If this woman took
the money and went, would not Rose, in the course
of time, relent in her attitude of iron disapproval,
and smile on the man she loved? Could any
woman hold out for ever in such a position?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[476]</span>&#8220;See here,&#8221; Berny went on, &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave a statement.
I&#8217;ll put it in your hands that I changed
my mind and voluntarily left. I&#8217;ll draw it up
before a notary if you want. And it&#8217;s true. She
needn&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m being forced out to make
a place for her. I&#8217;m glad to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had leaned nearer to him from the chair,
one finger tapping the corner of the desk to
emphasize her words. Scrutinizing her as she
spoke, he became more than ever impressed with
the conviction that she was held in a tremor of
febrile excitement. Her voice had an under note
of vibration in it, like the voice of one who breathes
quickly. The orchid on her breast trembled with
the trembling of her frame.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;I want to
understand this thing. What&#8217;s made you change
your mind so suddenly? A few days ago you
were all up on fiddle-strings at the suggestion of
taking that money. Here, this morning, in you
pop, and you&#8217;re all of a tremble to get it. What&#8217;s
the meaning of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stand it any more,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When
you said I couldn&#8217;t the other day, that I&#8217;d break
down, you were right. I can&#8217;t stand it. Nobody
could. It&#8217;s broken me to pieces. I want to get
away from it all. I want to go somewhere where
I&#8217;m at peace, where the people don&#8217;t hate me
and hound me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice suddenly grew hoarse and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[477]</span>
stopped. He looked at her in surprise. She bent
her face down, biting her under lip, and picked
tremulously at the leaves of the purple orchid
as if arranging them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve beaten me,&#8221; she said in a suddenly
strangled voice, &#8220;you&#8217;ve beaten me. I can&#8217;t
fight any longer. Give me some money and let
me go. I&#8217;m beaten.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lowered her head still farther and burst
into tears. So unexpected were they that she
had no preparations for them. Her handkerchief
was in the bead purse that hung on her wrist,
and, blinded by tears, she could not find the
clasp. Her fumbling hand tried for a possible
reserve supply in her belt, and then in despair
went up to her face and lifted her veil trying to
brush away the falling drops. The Bonanza
King stared at her amazed, as much surprised
as if he had seen a man weep. Finally he felt
in his own pocket, produced a crisply-laundered
square of white linen and handed it to her,
observing soothingly,</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, take mine. You&#8217;re all broke up, aren&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She seized his offering and mopped her cheeks
with it, sniffing and gasping, while he watched
her in genuine solicitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wore you down to this state?&#8221; he
said. &#8220;You&#8217;re the nerviest woman I ever
saw.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[478]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s&mdash;all this thing,&#8221; she answered in a
stifled voice. &#8220;I&#8217;m just worn out. I haven&#8217;t
slept for nights,&#8221;&mdash;a memory of those miserable
nights of perturbation and uncertainty swept over
her and submerged her in a wave of self-pity.
The tears gushed out again, and she held the old
man&#8217;s large handkerchief against her eyes, uttering
small, sobbing noises, sunk in abandoned
despondence in the hollow of the chair.</p>

<p>The Bonanza King was moved. The facile
tears of women did not affect him, but the tears
of this bold, hard, unbreakable creature, whom
he had regarded only as an antagonist to be
vanquished, stirred him to a sort of abashed sympathy.
There was something singularly pathetic
about the completeness of her breakdown. She,
who had been so audacious an adversary, now in
all her crumpled finery weeping into his handkerchief,
was so entirely and utterly a feeble, crushable
thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, brace up,&#8221; he said cheeringly. &#8220;We
can&#8217;t do any talking while you&#8217;re acting this way.
What&#8217;s the proposition again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want some money and I want to go.&#8221;
She raised her head and lowered the handkerchief,
speaking with a strained, throaty insistence like
a child. &#8220;I can&#8217;t live here any more. I can&#8217;t
bear it. It would give a prize fighter nervous
prostration. I can&#8217;t bear it.&#8221; Her voice grew
small and high. &#8220;Really I can&#8217;t,&#8221; she managed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[479]</span>
to articulate, and then dissolved into another
flood.</p>

<p>The old man, high in his swivel chair, sat with
his hands in his pockets, his lips pursed and his
eyes on the floor. Once or twice he whirled the
chair slightly from one side to the other. After
a pause of some minutes he said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you prepared to agree to everything
Mrs. Ryan and I demanded?&#8221;</p>

<p>After the last outbreak she had completely
abandoned herself to the hysterical condition that
was beyond her control. Now she made an effort
to recover herself, sat up, swallowing and gasping,
while she wiped her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to do it all,&#8221; she sniffed, &#8220;only&mdash;only&mdash;&#8221;
she paused on the verge of another
collapse, suppressed it, and said with some show
of returning animation, &#8220;only I must have some
money now&mdash;a guarantee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said with the descending note of
comprehension. &#8220;As I remember, we agreed to
pay you seven thousand dollars for the first year,
the year of desertion.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lowered the handkerchief entirely, presenting
to him a disfigured face, all its good looks
gone, but showing distinct signs of attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want the seven thousand. I&#8217;ll waive
it. I want a sum down, a guarantee, an advance.
You offered me at first fifty thousand dollars.
Give me that down and I&#8217;ll go this afternoon.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[480]</span>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t our original arrangement,&#8221; he
said to gain time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Deduct it from the rest. I must have it.
I can&#8217;t go without it. If you give me the check
now I&#8217;ll leave for New York to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her reviving interest and force seemed to have
quenched the sources of her tears as suddenly
as her exhausted nerves had made them flow.
But her disfigured face, her figure which seemed
to have shrunken in its fine clothes, were
extremely pathetic.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t trust me send one of your clerks
with me to buy my ticket, send one to see me off.
I&#8217;ve left my husband for good, for ever. I can&#8217;t
live here any longer. Give me the money and
let me go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that I&#8217;m going to have any security
that you&#8217;re going to carry out the whole plan.
How do I know that you&#8217;re not going to New
York to have a good time and then, when you&#8217;ve
spent the money, come back here?&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat up and sent a despairing look about the
room as if in a wild search for something that
would convince him of her sincerity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>swear</i>, I <i>promise</i>,&#8221; she cried with almost
frantic emphasis, &#8220;that I&#8217;ll never come back.
I&#8217;m going for good and I&#8217;m going to set Dominick
free. Oh, <i>do</i> believe me. <i>Please.</i> I&#8217;m telling
the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was impressed by her manner, as he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[481]</span>
been by her tears. Something undoubtedly had
happened which had suddenly caused her to
change her mind and decide to leave her husband.
He did not think that it was what she had told
him. Her excitement, her overwrought condition
suggested a cause less gradual, more like a shock.
He ran over in his mind the advantages of giving
her the money. Nothing would be jeopardized
by it. It would simply be an advance made on
the sum they had agreed upon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifty thousand&#8217;s too much,&#8221; he said slowly.
&#8220;But I&#8217;ll be square to you and I&#8217;ll split the difference
and give you twenty-five. I&#8217;ll give you the
check now and you can take it and go to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head obstinately.</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t do,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What difference does
it make to you whether you give it to me now
or next year? I&#8217;ll give you a receipt for it. There
won&#8217;t be any trouble about it. It&#8217;s as broad as
it&#8217;s long. It&#8217;s simply an advance on the main
sum.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked moodily at her and then down.
Her demand seemed reasonable enough, but he
distrusted her.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t believe me,&#8221; she insisted, &#8220;send
out that clerk of yours to buy my ticket to New
York. Tell him to go up to the flat and he&#8217;ll see
my trunks all packed and ready. I tell you you&#8217;ve
beaten me. You and Mrs. Ryan are one too
many for me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[482]</span>He again looked at her, his lips pressed together,
his eye coldly considering.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you thirty thousand dollars and it&#8217;s
understood that you&#8217;re to leave the city to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>She demurred, but with less show of vigor, and,
for a space, they haggled over the sum till they
finally agreed upon thirty-five thousand dollars.</p>

<p>As the old man drew the check she watched him
with avid eagerness, restraining by force the
hand that trembled in its anxiety to become
possessed of the slip of paper. He noticed, as she
bent over the desk to sign the receipt, that her
fingers shook so they could hardly direct the pen.
She remarked it herself, setting it down to her
upset nerves, and laughing at the sprawling
signature.</p>

<p>With the check in her hand she rose, something
of the airy buoyancy of demeanor that had marked
her on her entrance returning to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, opening her purse, &#8220;this is
the real beginning of our business relations. I
feel as if we were partners.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man gave a short, dry laugh. He could
not rid his mind of suspicions of her and the
whole proceeding, though he did not see just how
she could be deceiving him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till next year,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When I see the
divorce papers I&#8217;ll feel a lot surer of the partnership.&#8221;</p>

<p>She snapped the clasp of her purse, laughing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[483]</span>
and moving to the door. She was wild to get
away, to escape from the dark room that held
such unpleasant memories, and the old man,
whose steely penetrating eye, fastened on her,
was full of unsatisfied query.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, so long!&#8221; she cried, opening the door.
&#8220;Next time we meet it will be more sociable, I
hope. We really ought to be old friends by this
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>She hardly knew what she was saying, but she
laughed with a natural gaiety, and in the doorway
turned and bowed her jaunty good-bys to him.
He stood back and nodded good-humoredly at
her, his face showing puzzlement under its slight,
ironic smile.</p>

<p>Once in the street her demeanor again changed.
Her step became sharp and quick, her expression
keenly absorbed and concentrated. A clock
showed her that it was nearly half-past ten, and
she walked, with a speed that was as rapid a mode
of progression as it could be without attracting
attention, to the great bank on which the check
was drawn. On the way down on the car she
had thought out all her movements, just what
she would do, and where she would go. Her
mind was as clear, her movements as systematic
as though she were moved by mechanism.</p>

<p>She ran up the steps to the bank and presented
the check at the paying teller&#8217;s window.</p>

<p>&#8220;In one-thousand dollar bills, if you please,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[484]</span>
she said, trying not to speak breathlessly, &#8220;all
but five hundred, and you can give me that in
one-hundreds.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man knew her, made some vaguely-polite
remark, and took the slip of paper back into
unseen regions. Berny stood waiting, throbbing
from head to foot with excitement. She was not
afraid they would refuse to cash the check. Her
sole fear was that Cannon, as soon as she was gone,
might have regretted his action and telephoned
from his office to stop the payment on it. She
knew that once the money was hers he would not
make any attempt to get it back. His own
reputation and that of his daughter were too
inextricably bound up with the transaction for
him to dare to apprehend or punish Berny for
her deception.</p>

<p>Her heart gave a wild leap as she saw the
teller returning, and then pause behind the netting
of his golden cage while he counted out the bills.
She tried to speak lightly to him as he laid them
one by one on the glass slab. She was hardly
conscious of what she said; all she realized was
that the crisp roll of paper in her fingers was her
possession, if not of great fortune, at least of
something to stand between her and the world.</p>

<p>When she left the bank she walked forward
slowly, the excitement which had carried her on
to this point having suddenly left her feeling
weak and tired. She entered the railway office<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[485]</span>
and bought her ticket for New York for that
evening&#8217;s train. Then once more emerging into
the sunshine she directed her steps to the car
which would take her to her sisters. She had
decided to spend her last day in San Francisco
with them. As the car whisked her up the hills
she carefully pondered on how much she would
tell them, where truth was advisable and where
fiction would serve a better purpose.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br />


<small>THE STORM CENTER MOVES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>As soon as Berny had left his office Bill Cannon
wrote a note to Mrs. Ryan, telling her of the
interview he had just had with her daughter-in-law.
He did not mention the check, simply
stating Berny&#8217;s decision to accept their proposal
and leave her husband. The matter was of too
intimate a nature to trust to the telephone and
he sent the note by one of his own clerks, who
had instructions to wait for an answer, as the
old man did not know what Mrs. Ryan might
already have heard from Dominick.</p>

<p>It threw its recipient into a state of agitated,
quivering exultation. Mrs. Ryan had heard nothing
from her son, and her hopes of the separation
had sunk to the lowest ebb. Not so prudent as
Cannon, she called up Dominick at the bank, asking
him if it were true that his wife had left him,
and beseeching him simply to tell her &#8220;yes&#8221; or
&#8220;no.&#8221; The young man, hampered by the publicity
of his surroundings and his promise to Berny,
answered her with the utmost brevity, telling her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[487]</span>
that there had been a change in his domestic
life but that he could not enter into details now.
He begged her to ask him no further questions
as he would be at home at three o&#8217;clock that
afternoon, when he would explain the whole
matter to her.</p>

<p>She wrote this to the Bonanza King and sent
it by his waiting messenger. The old man felt
relieved when he read the letter. He was confident
now that Berny had not deceived him.
She had told the truth, and was leaving the
town and her husband, for what reason he
could not yet be sure, but there seemed no doubt
that she was going. They would ignore
the subject before Rose, and, in the course
of time, Dominick would break down the unflinching
resistance she had threatened to make to his
suit. The old man felt buoyant and exhilarated.
It looked as if things were at last going their way.</p>

<p>He sent a message to Mrs. Ryan, asking her to
let him know as soon as possible what Dominick
said, and waited in his office in a state of tension
very foreign to his usual iron stolidity. It was
four o&#8217;clock before word came from her in the
form of a telephone message, demanding his
presence at her house at the earliest possible
moment. He responded to it at once, and in
the sitting-room of the Ryan mansion heard
from Dominick&#8217;s own lips the story of his false and
tragic marriage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[488]</span>The old man listened, unwinking, speechless,
immovable. It was the one thing he had never
thought of, a solution of the situation that was
as completely unexpected to him as death would
have been. He said nothing to Dominick about
the money he had given Berny, did not mention
having seen her. A sharp observer might have
noticed that he looked a little blank, that, the
first shock of surprise over, there was a slight
expression of wandering attention in his eye, a
suggestion of mental faculties inwardly focusing
on an unseen point, about his manner.</p>

<p>He walked home, deeply thinking, abashed a
little by the ease with which Fate unties the
knots that man&#8217;s clumsy fingers work over in
vain. And it was untied. They were free&mdash;the
boy and girl he loved&mdash;to realize his and their
own dreams. It would need no years of wooing
to melt Rose from stony resistance. Nobody had
been sacrificed.</p>

<p>He felt a sense of gratitude toward Berny.
Down in his heart he was conscious of a stirring
of something that was kindly, almost affectionate,
toward her. It did not require a great stretch
of imagination to see himself and her as two
knowing, world-battered rogues who had combined
to let youth and innocence have their
happiness. He could almost feel the partnership
with her she had spoken of, a sort of bond of
Masonic understanding, a kindred attitude in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[489]</span>
matters of ethics. They had a mutually low
estimate of human nature, a bold, cool unscrupulousness,
a daring courage that never faltered.
In fact, he was sorry he had not given Berny the
whole fifty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>&#8220;She could have got it out of me,&#8221; he said to
himself, pondering pensively. &#8220;If she&#8217;d stuck
out for it I&#8217;d have given it to her. And she
might just as well have had it.&#8221;</p>

<p>That evening for the first time in nearly three
years Dominick Ryan dined with his mother in
the great dining-room of the Ryan mansion.
Cornelia was out with Jack Duffy, so Mrs.
Ryan had her boy all to herself and she beamed
and glowed and gloated on him as he sat opposite
her, the reddened light of the candles falling on
his beloved, familiar face.</p>

<p>After dinner they went into the sitting-room,
the sanctum with the ebonized cherry furniture
where the family always retired when important
matters were afoot. Here, side by side, they
sat before the fireplace with the portrait of the
late Cornelius Ryan looking benignly down on
them. They did not talk much. The subject of
the young man&#8217;s marriage had been thoroughly
gone over in the afternoon. Later on, his mother
would extract from him further particulars, till
she would be as conversant with that miserable
chapter of his life as if she had lived it herself.</p>

<p>To-night they were both in the quiescent state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[490]</span>
that follows turmoil and strife. They sat
close together, staring into space, now and then
dropping one of the short disconnected sentences
that indicate a fused, understanding intimacy.
The young man&#8217;s body was limp in his chair,
his mind lulled in the restorative lethargy, the
suspension of activities, that follows a struggle.
His thoughts shrank shudderingly from the past,
and did not seek to penetrate the future. He
rested in a torpor of relief through which a
dreamy sense of happiness came dimly, as if in
the faintest, most delicate whispers.</p>

<p>His mother&#8217;s musings were definite and practical.
She could now make that settlement, share and
share alike, on both children that she had long
desired&mdash;Cornelia&#8217;s would be a dowry on her
wedding day and Dominick&#8217;s&mdash;well, Dominick
had had hard times enough. She would go down
to-morrow morning and see her lawyer about it.</p>

<p>At the same hour, in the house of the other
rich man, the Bonanza King, having driven the
servants from the room with violent words that
did not indicate bad humor so much as high
spirits, told his daughter the story. He told it
shortly, hardly more than the main facts, and
when it was concluded, forbore to make comments
or, in fact, to look at her. It was a great deliverance,
but he was not quite sure that his darling
would experience the frank, unadulterated joy
that had possessed both himself and Mrs. Ryan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">[491]</span>
without restraining qualms. He did not know
what to say to Rose. There were mysterious
complexities in her character that made him
decide to confine his statement to a recital of
facts, eliminating those candid expressions of
feeling which he could permit himself when
talking to Mrs. Ryan or Berny.</p>

<p>As soon as he had told it all he rose from his
chair as if ending the interview. His daughter
rose too, pale and silent, and he put his arm
round her shoulders and pressed her against his
chest in a good-night hug. She kissed him and
went up stairs to her own rooms, and he returned
to his arm-chair at the end of the dining-table.
Here, as was his wont, he sat smoking and pondering,
turning over in his head the various
aspects of the curious story and its unexpected
outcome. Once, as the memory of Berny weeping
into his handkerchief recurred to him, he
stirred uneasily and muttered to himself,</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t the damned fool stick out for
the whole fifty thousand? I&#8217;d have given it to
her as soon as not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meantime the storm center, the focus round
which the hopes and angers and fears of this
little group had circled, was speeding eastward
in the darkness of the early night. Berny sat
in the corner of her section with her luggage piled
high on the seat before her, a pillow behind her
head. In the brightly clear light, intensified by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[492]</span>
reflections from glazed woodwork and the surfaces
of mirrors, she looked less haggard, calmer
and steadier, than she had looked for many weeks.
Relief was at her heart. Now that she had turned
her back on it she realized how she had hated it
all&mdash;the flat, the isolation, the unsuccessful
struggle, Dominick and his superior ways.</p>

<p>The excitement of change, the desire of the
new, the unfamiliar, the untried, which had
taken her far afield once before, sang in her
blood and whispered its siren song in her ear.
She had missed a fortune, but still she had something.
She was not plunging penniless into the
great outside world, and she pressed her hand
against her chest where the thirty-five thousand
dollars was sewed into the lining of her bodice.
Thirty-five thousand dollars! It was a good deal
if it wasn&#8217;t three hundred thousand.</p>

<p>As the train thundered on through the darkness
she saw before her the lights of great cities,
and heard the call of liberty, the call of the nomad
and the social vagabond, the call of the noisy
thoroughfare, of the bright places, of the tumult
and the crowd. The roving passion of the wanderer,
to whom the spell of home is faint as a
whisper in the night, passed into her veins like the
invigorating heat of wine. She exulted in the
sense of her freedom, in the magic of adventure,
in the wild independence of the unknown.</p>

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
